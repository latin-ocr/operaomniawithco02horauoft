38 HoRATn' SATIRARUM

Verba putas ? ’

‘ Egomet mi ignosco,' Maenius inquit.

Stultus et improbus hic amor est dignusque notari.

Cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis, 25
Cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum

Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius? At tibi contra
Evenit, inquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.

Iracundior est paulo, minus aptus acutis

Naribus horum hominum3 rideri possit eo quod 30
Rusticius tonso toga defluit, et male laxus

In pede calceus haeret: at est bonus ut melior vir

cheat ;‘ Ter. Andr. 1. 3. 6, Cic. ad
Att. 15. 16.

23. ignosco. Horace plays on the
etymology. ‘ Is it that you are blind,
or that you think us blind ³⁴? ‘ I shut my
own eyes'; ‘ non ignoro sed ignosco.'

24. improbus, ἀναιδής, the leading
idea being, as often, os excess.

amor, the love shown by that answer,
ie. ‘ seli-love.y

notari, properly of the censor's mark
affixed to the name by way of ignominy,
thence metaphorically ; cp. Sat. 1. 4. 5,
106, 1. 6.14‚ 2. 7. 8; Epp. 1. 17. 15.

25. pervideas. Bentley would read
‘ praevideas . . . mala‚' the former a conj.
osRutgers, confirmed by one or two later
MSS„ which he interprets in the sense of
παραβλέπειν in the apposite verses prob-
ably of Menander (Meineke, Menandri
Reliquiae Incert. 5) τί τάλλότριον,
ἄνθρωπε βασκανώτατε, Ι κακὸν ὀξυδορκεῖς,
τὸ δ’ ἴδιον παραβλέπεις; ‘ mala' he joins
to ‘ lippus.’ The use however of ‘ prae-
videre' Ζ ‘pi·aetervidere,⁷ ‘to overlook‚’ is
unsupported. ‘ Pervideas' has its natural
sense, ‘ to look all through,' as Ov. Pont.
1. 8. 34 ‘Cunctaque mens oculis per-
videt illa suis.’ For the oxymoron
‘ pervideas lippus ’ cp. (with Bentl.) Od.
3. 7. 21 ‘scopulis surdior Icari Voces
audit,' Sat. Ι. 2. 91 ‘ Hypsaea caecior. . .
spectes.’

inunctis, while they are still smart-
ing from the application of the ointment,
and so incapable of sight.

27. aquila. Hom. Il. 17. 674 ὥστ’
αἰετός, ὅν ῥά τέ φασιν Ι ὀξύτατον δέρκεσ-
θαι ὑπουρανίων πετεηνῶν.

Epidaurius. The snakes of Epi-
daurus were probably proverbial in the
mouths of Romans, from the story of the
snake of Aesculapius brought from Epi-
daurus to Rome in B.C. 291, and lodged

on the island in the Tiber.

eontra: ‘vicissim‚⁷ ‘in return]

29. The Scholiasts have a story that
this picture ofthe passionate and slovenly
man of genius is intended sor the poet
Virgil. This may rest upon some early
tradition, but it is unlikely in itself.
Such guesses are easy to make and
impossible to disprove. Cp. the identi-
fication of the poet Propertius with the
‘bore' in Sat. 1. 9.

aptus =‘ placens.‘

acutis naribus, of delicate perception ;
opp. ‘ obesae naris ' Epod. 12. Cp. ‘ em-
unctae naris’ Sat. 1. 4. 8. The Schol.
offers an alternative explanation, taking
‘ aptus ' as= ‘ aptus serendis,’ and ‘ acutis
naribns' like ‘naribus uti’ Epp. 1. 19.
45, ‘ adunco naso⁷ Sat. 1. 6. 5, of the

grimace of contempt, ‘intolerant of

criticism.’ Bentley, showing that ‘acutae
nares ’ could hardly have this meaning,
would alter it to ⁶ aduncis.'

30. horum, ‘ of our time.' A common
usage, Liv. 1. 55 ‘ horum magnificentiae
operum.' Cp. infr. v. 60 ‘hoc genus vitae.‘

eo, ⁴ for the reason,⁷ Sat. 2. 8. 65.

31. rusticius with ‘ tonso.’ Cp. ‘ cu-
ratus inaequali tonsore’ Epp. 1. 1. 94.

defluit, ‘ hangs‚’ ‘ slips from the
shoulder.' Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 96 ‘ toga
dissidet impar.’ For the great pains
taken in adjusting the ‘toga ⁷ see Quintil.
11. 3. 137 soll.

male with haeret, or ιἰπό κοινοῦ with
‘haeret' and ‘ laxus‚’ as below v. 45.
Cp. Ov. A. A. 1. 516 ‘ Nec vagus in laxa
pes tibi pelle natet.'

32. at . . at . . at. The repetition of the
particle ‘ yet,’ ⁴ yet,’ ‘ yet' gives rhetori—
cal emphasis. So ‘ sed' in Juv. Sat. 5.
61, 8. 149. For ‘ at’ in this sense,
urging a plea in arrest of judgment‚ ep.
O( . 2. 18. 9.
