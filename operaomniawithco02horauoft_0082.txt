HORATII SATIRARUM

Inde Rubos fessi pervenimuS, utpote longum

Carpentcs iter et factum corruptius imbri. 95
Postera tempestas melior, via peior ad usque

Bari moenia piscosi; dein Gnatia Lymphis

Iratis exstructa dedit risusque iocosque,

Dum flamma sine thura liquescere limine sacro

Persuadere cupit.

Credat Iudaeus Apella,

100

Non ego: namque deos didici securum agere aevum,
Nec si quid miri faciat natura, deos id

Tristes ex alto caeli demittere tecto.

Brundisium longae finis chartaeque viaeque est.

94. Rubos, hod. Ruvo.

longum iter, thirty Roman miles.
This upper road from Beneventum by
Brundisium is described by Strabo
26. 282) as not more than a bridle road
(ἡμιονική), the carriage road (ἁμαξήλατος
μᾶλλον) passing through Venusia and
Tarentum.

95. carpentes = ‘ quia carpebamus.'
See a note of Kritz on Sall. Jug. 10. 2.

corruptius: ‘iter’ in this clause is
the road itself.

97. Bari piscosi. At Barium the
road struck the coast, which thence-
l'orward it follows. Bari is the first
important station (seventy-five miles)
on the railroad from Brindisi. It is,
as it was, a fishing town.

Gnatia, or Egnatia, thirty-seven
Roman miles from Barium. The miracle
is mentioned by Pliny, N. H. 2. 111
‘ In Salentino oppido Egnatia imposito
ligno in saxum quoddam ibi sacrum
protinus flammam exsistere?

Lymphis iratis, ‘under the dis-
pleasure of the water-goddesses.' Cp.
Sat. 2. 3. 8 ‘iratis natus paries dis)
Yarro R. R. 1. 1. 6 has ‘Lympha' as
a water-goddess, and the appellation
has been found in inscriptions. The

word is apparently the same as Nympha
(cp. Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘lymphatam ⁷), an
earlier or alternative transliteration from
the Greek. For other instances of the
change between l and n see Curtius,
Etym. 3. 37, Meyer, Vergl. Gr. 1. 65.

99. dum. . . cupit. For tense see
supr. on v. 72.

100. Apella, the Roman form of the
Greek Apellas or Apelles, as Marsya
Sat. 1. 6. 120, etc. It seems to be a
special name taken at random for one
of a class, as Dama, Davus, etc.‚ a
Jewish sreedman. The name is fre-
quent among ‘libertini’ in inscriptions;
three of the name are mentioned in
Cicero.

101. namque deos didici, ‘I am
one os those of whom Lueretius speaks
who have learnt his lesson' t5. 83 and
6. 56) ³ bene qui didicere deos securum
agere aevum.'

103. tristes, as Mr. Yonge points
out, corresponds to ‘ securum' v. 101 ;
the special lesson which he has unlearnt
is that natural phenomena are expres-
sions of emotion in the gods. ‘ Tristes ’
is the opp. of ‘ laeti ' Od. 3. 21. 21.

104. que . . . que: as of the journey
so of the story.
