SAT. 6.

Pellibus et latum demisit pectore clavum,

Audit continuo: ‘Quis homo hic est? quo patre natus?'
Ut si qui aegrotet quo morbo Barrus, haberi 30
Et cupiat formosus, eat quacunque, puellis

Iniiciat curam quaerendi singula, quali

Sit facie, sura, quali pede, dente, capillo:

Sic qui promittit cives, urbem sibi curae,

Imperium fore et Italiam, delubra deorum, 35
Quo patre sit natus, num ignota matre inhonestus,

Omnes mortales curare et quaerere cogit.

‘Tunc Syri, Damae, aut Dionysi filius, audes

Deicere de saxo cives aut tradere Cadmo?'

‘At Novius collega gradu post me sedet uno; 40

Namque est ille, pater quod erat meus.’

‘ Hoc tibi Paulus

Et Messalla videris? At hic, si plostra ducenta
Concurrantque foro tria funera, magna sonabit

apparently red (⁴ mulleus’), fastened
higher up the leg than other shoes (cp.
‘ medium impediit crus ’) with four
strapz. (⁴ corrigiae& of black leather, and
with a crescent (ζ luna’ Juv. 1. c.) at-
tached in front.

31. et. The reading of the best
MSS„ including ‘omnes Ciuq.' It is
epexegetic of the clause which precedes
the ‘same malady as that of Barrus,'
being the desire to be thought hand-
some. ‘Ut,' which Orelli adopts, was
a late reading, and intended to make
this sense still clearer.

34. promittit, ‘undertakes‚' i. e. in
offering himself sor high office.

35. imperium: see on Od. Ι. 2. 26.
Here its conjunctior] with ‘ ltaliam'
marks its special reference to the foreign
dominion‚ ‘provinciae’

38. Syri, etc. : three familiar names
ofslaves; for Damae see on Sat. 2. 5. 18.

39. ‘To exercise extreme powers
against Roman citizens.’ The special
powers named are ideal (cp. Lucr. 3.
1029 ‘Carcer et horribilis de saxo iactus
eorum, Verbera, carnifices')‚ and we
need not ask too particularly what spe-
cial magistrate exercised them. Hurl-
ing from the Tarpeian rock was still a
recognised punishment in certain cases.
Tac. Ann. 2. 32, 4. 29, 6. 19.

deicere, a trisyll. See Virg. Ecl. 3.
96 ‘reice capellas] Some MSS. how-
ever have ‘ e' for ‘ de.' So Orelli.

tradere Cadmo. ‘ Cadmus carnifex
illo tempore fuisse dicitur' Porph. In
answer to the obiection taken by some
editors that the ‘ carnifex ’ had nothing
to do with Roman citizens, Cic. pro
Rab. 411 is quoted, ‘tu qui civibus Ro-
manis carnificem, qui vincula, adhiberi
put-is oportere.' There is rather less
variety than usual in the MSS. as to a
proper name, but the explanation may
be a guess. Acrxhas, aster a note to
the same effect as Porphyrion's, ‘ tradere,
in exilium mitteres which seems to mean
that ‘ Cadmo’ (or some other word of
which it is a corruption> had been taken
as the name of a place.

40. Novius can hardly but be a
name chose-n forits etymology, see p. 14.

gradu sedet. The expression is here
figurative, though taken from the dis>
tinctions of place in the theatre; the
real difference is explained in the fol-
lowing line.

41. hoc = ‘ideoj ‘therein,' ‘there-
fore? Paulus, Messalla, the names of
high aristocratic families.

43. concurrantque . . . vincatque:
for the place of ‘ que’ in each case see
on Od. 1. 30. 6. For the noise ofa
great funeral the editors quote Seneca
(de Morte Claudii, p. 681) ‘ Et erat om-
nium formosissimum [Claudii funus] et
impensa cura plenum, ut scires deum
efferri; tibicinum, cornicinum, omnisque
generis aeneatorum tanta turba, tantus
