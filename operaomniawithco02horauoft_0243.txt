EPISTLE ΙΙΙ.

ΤΟ JULIUS FLORUS.

Vel-ses 1—6. 1 WANT to know all about the progress os Tiberius'journey‚ and quite
as much about the literary occupatiori of his staff.

7, 8. who is to write the panegyric of the reign?

9<14. What is Titius about, that brave imitator of Pindar? his promising lyrics ;
or tragedy which lends itself too easily to rant 2

15—20. What of Celsus? Ι hope he is remembering the warning to avoid too
much imitation.

21—29. And yourselfi on which of your many interests are you busy? Yon have
great gifts and have cultivated them. Distinction is assured to you if you aie
seeking it, in oratory, in legal knowledge, in poetry. If you would take the
right course you might attain the still greater happiness of the philosopher.
That is the true end of life.

30-36. One more question. How do you stand with Munatius? Do you value
him as you should? or is the quarrel imperfectly made up 3

Farewell. I am looking anxiously for the return of both of you.

The Epistle is addressed to Julius Florus, to whom Horace addresses also the
second Epistle of Book ΙΙ. See introd. to that Epistle.

Florus is probably identified with the Florus who is named by the elder Seneca
(Controv. 4. 25) as a pupil in oratory of M. Porcius Latro, a famous ⁶ rhetor' of
Augustus⁷ time and by Quintilian 10. 3. 14 as ‘ in eloquentia Galliarum, quoniam
ibi demum eam exercuit, princeps ' (cp. v. 23 os this Epistle). The Scholiasts
say ‘ Hic Florus fuit Satirarum scriptor, cuius sunt electae ex Ennio Lucilio
Varrone cet) This has been explained to mean that he published selections <Pliny
uses the word ‘ electa’ in this sense Epp. 8. 21) from these older poets, perhaps
modernized (see introd. to Sat. 1. 10).

He, with other young men of literary tastes‚ is in the suite of the Emperor's
elder stepson Tiberius, who has been sent on a mission by Augustus to the East, in
the year Β. C. 20, to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia.
