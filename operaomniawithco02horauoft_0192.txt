HORATII SATIRARUM

Ingenium, utque soles custos mihi maximus adsis, 15
Ergo ubi me in montes et in arcem ex urbe removi,

Quid prius illustrem satiris musaque pedestri?

Nec mala me ambitio perdit nee plumbeus Auster
Autumnusque graviS, Libitinae quaestus acerbae.

Matutine pater, seu, Iane, libentius audis, 20
Unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores

Instituunt, sic dis placitum, tu carminis esto

Principium. Romae sponsorem me rapis: ⁶ Eia,

Ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, urge.'

Sive Aquilo radit terras seu bruma nivalem 25
Interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est.

16. in montes et in arcem: see
Od. 2. 6. 22 n.‚ my mountain stronghold,
safe retreat.

17. satiris : Sat. 2. 1. 1. See Introd.
to Satires, p. 6.

musa pedestri: see on Od. 2. 12. 9,
and cp. A. P. 95; and with the de-
scription ofhis Satires as ‘prose-poetry'
ep. Sat. Ι. 4. 42, 48 ‘ sermoni pr0pi01·a‚’
‘ nisi quod certo Sermoni differt, sermo
merus.' and Epp. 2. Ι, 250 ‘sermones

. . repentes per humum?

IS. ambitio, the pretentious and
pushing lise of the city. Horace speaks
here as isin Rome he could not keep
quite clear of it. In Sat. J. 6. 129 he
classes himself as one ‘solutorum misera
ambitione gravique.' Orelli quotes
()vid's pretty line, Met. 11. 765 ‘Se-
cretos montes et inambitiosa colebat
Rura)

plumbeus Auster: ofthe depressing
effect of the seirocco: Od. 2. 14. 16.

19. Libitinae: Od. 3. 30. 7, Epp. 2.
1. 49, the goddess who presides over the
funeral rites, so that the sense is the same
as Epp. Ι. 7. 5 ‘ ficus prima calorque
Dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris?

quaestus, ⁵ a source of gain to.'

20. The commencement is mock
heroic. He proceeds ‘illustrare ruris
felicitatem ' by painting the troubles of
life in Rome. The form is as Virg. Eel.
3. 60 ‘ ab Iove principium,' Theoe. 17. 1
ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα, Arat. I'haen. 1 ἐκ
Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθαῑ cp. Od. Ι. 12. 13.

matutine pater, ‘sire, god of the
morning.' The Roman conception of
Ianus as the god of beginnings, en-
tramea undertakings‚ is described in
Ovid, Fast. 1. 63 foll. He was wor-

shipped at the beginning of the year,
the mouth, the day.

Iane, audis. For the use of‘ audire‚'
like the Gr. ἀκούειν, in the sense of ‘ to
be named,’ cp. Sat. 2. 7. 101, Epp. 1. 7.
38, 1. 16. 17. For the vocative ‘Iane'
cp. Od. 2. 20. 6n. ‘ quem vocas, dilecte.'
It is the actual address which the god
would ⁸ hear.' It is helped by the pre-
ceding vocative as though it were ⁴ vel
Iane, si id libentius au‹lis.'

21. unde = ‘ a qno? Od.1. 12. 1711.

23. sponsorem. So in the
distractions sor a poet in Rome, Epp. 2.
2. 67 ⁶ Hic sponsum vocat.’ Ianus is
said to ‘hurry him off to be surety for
a friend‚' with the meaning that this is
the first occupation of his morning.

eia . . . urge, the words with which
Ianus presses him. For ‘eia' cp. Sat.
1. 1. 18 n.

24. urge. We are not to understand a
personal object; the true parallel of the
use <as Schiitz points out) is the con-
struction ‘ urgere opus‚' ‘to push on
a work ’ς for ‘ opus’ is substituted the
obj.-ciause ‘ ne prior. . . quisquam‚’ etc.‚
‘be instant that none be before y0u‚'
etc. Cp. Od. 2. 18. 10 n.

officio respondeat, as Cic. ‘officio
satisfacere‚’ to fulfil an expected service.

25. ‘ However cold the wind or dark
the mornings.'

26. interiore .. . gyro: a smaller
circle, the arc traversed apparently by the
sun growing smaller from day to day.

trahit, best taken with the Scholiasts
as=‘breviorem facit,' ‘contrahit'; cp.
Lucr. 6. 967 ‘ coria et carnem trahit et
conducit in unum.' It is also explained
of making the day come slowly.
