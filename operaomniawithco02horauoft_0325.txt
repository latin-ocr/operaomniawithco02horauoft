LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 18. 309

Quem damnosa Venus, quem praeceps alea nudat,

Gloria quem supra vires et vestit et ungit,

Quem tenet argenti sitis importuna famesque,

Quem paupertatis pudor et fuga, dives amicis,

Saepe decem vitiis instructior, odit et horret: 25
Aut si non odit, regit ac veluti pia mater

Plus quam se sapere et virtutibus esse priorem

Volt, et ait prope vera: ‘Meae (contendere noli)
Stultitiam patiuntur opes; tibi parvula res est:

Arta decet sanum comitem toga3 desine mecum 30

Certare.'

21 foll. We pass to another point,
‘ whatever his own habits a patron hates
extravagance in his dependent.⁷

21. damnosa, as in Epp. 2. 1. 1073
from the special use of ‘damnum' for
waste of money, Od. 3. 5. 27, Sat. 2.
2. 95.

praeceps: such an epithet does not
bear too rigid and logical examination.
It is appropriate in several senses; a
poet feels the appropriateness, but does
not analyze them and limit his meaning
to one of them. Dicing is ‘headlong'
because it is a passion which makes
men forget everything else, because it
leads over a precipice of ruin‚ ete. Cp.
‘ periculosae aleae ⁷ Od. 2. Ι. 6, though
there the dice are metaphorical.

22. gloria, subjecfively, as is usual
in Horace, the love of glory—glory as
a motive; and, as is also usual, in the
meaner sense, vainglory, vanity, Od. 1.
18. 153 Sat. 1. 6. 23, 2. 3. 179; Epp. 2.
1. 177.

supra vires vestit, Juv. S. 3. 180,
of the same subject, os extravagance of
dress, ‘supra vires habitus nitor.' Cp.
his phrase ibidv ‘ambitiosa paupertate‚'
¹ pretentious poverty.’

23. argenti, in the more common
sense of ‘ money‚' not (as Seh‘utz) ‘ silver-
plate ' as in Epp. 1. 6. 17, etc. Cp. ‘ auri
sacra fames’ Virg. Aen. 3. 57. Schiitz
complains of the tautology of the two
lines if this sense is given to ⁶ argenti ';
but greed of money and the shamefaced
dread of the appearance ofnarrow means
are sufficiently distinct.

25. decem vitiis instructior, the
abl. ofmeasure, ‘ more accomplished by
ten vices ' than himself.

26. regit, i. e. ‘corrigit,’ ‘schools,’
‘lecturesff

Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat

28. prope vera. The rich man's
words (Horace says with a cynical turn)
are ‘not very wide ofthe nuth? Vice is
a luxury allowed only to the rich.

contendere noli, ‘ do not try to
match me.' Cp. the fable of the Frog
and the Ox in Sat. 2. 2. 312 foll.

30. arta toga τ for a broad toga as a
mark of ostentation see on Epod. 4.
8 ‘ trium ulnarum toga,’ and on Sat. 2.
3. 183.

comitem: when he is walking with
his patron.

31-36. This is not, as Ritter, a con-
tinuation of the patron's speech, but
Horace’s comment upon it. ‘It was
good advice—especially the “arta toga„
—Eutrapelus well knew that the best
way to ruin a man was to give him a
set of smart clothes.⁷

31. Eutrapelus has been usually
supposed, since Lambinus suggested it,
to be the Volumnius to whom Cicero
addressed two letters, ad Fam. 7. 32 and
33, whom in ad Fam. 9. 26. 2 he calls
‘ Volumnius Eutrapelus,’ and who is, as
that epistle shows, the same as Eutra-
pelus the ‘collusor’ of M. Antonius.
whose mistress Cytheris had been ; Phil.
2. 8. 20, 24. 58, 13.
sible to disprove the identification, but
beyond the fact that Volumnius cur-
rently bore the name of Eutrapelus, and
as the first ofthe letters referred to seems
to imply from his wit, there is nothing
to connect him with Horace's anecdote.
There is an interesting history of the
word εὐτραπελία in Trench's Synonyms
os the New Test. pt. 1. from its treat-
ment in Arist. Eth. N. 4. 8 as the excel-
lent mean between βωμολοχία and ἀγροι-
κία, ‘wit that keeps the exact measure
of refinement,’ to its treatment by St.

affl. It is impos· l*-
