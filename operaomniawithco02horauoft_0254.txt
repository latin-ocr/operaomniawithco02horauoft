HORATII EPISTULARUM

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla

Imbuti spectent: quid censes munera terrae, 5
Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

Ludicra quid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,

· Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore? =

Qui timet his adversa fere miratur eodem ι

Quo cupiens pacto; pavor est utrobique molestus, 10
Improvisa simul species exterret utrumque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne‚ quid ad rem,

Si quicquid vidit melius peiusve sua spe

Defixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?

4. momentis, ‘ movements,' as in
Cic. de Nat. D. 2. 46 ‘astra .. . sua
momenta sustentant!

formidine nulla imbuti, ‘ with no
tinge of fear.’ The fear meant must be
the sear from which Lucretius' poem
was written to free mankind. The key
seems to be given in the epithet ‘ certis'
in v. 3. The philosopher does not
wonder or sear, because he learns the
law.

5. quid censes .. . quo spectanda
modo . . . eredis. The construction is
rightly illustrated by Cic. pro Rosc. Am.
17. 49 ‘ Quid censes hunc ipsum S. Ros-
cium, quo studio et qua intelligentia esse
in rusticis rebus?'‚ a more lively way of
saying ‘quo sturlio, etc. hunc S. Ros-
cium esse censes?' ‘Credis’ only re-
peats ‘ censes) It is an argument from
the greater to the less If philosophy
teaches indifference in the presence of
the great celestial movements of the
universe⁷ how much more in the pre-
sence of things terrestrial.

6. Arabas et Indos: Od. 3. 24. 1.

7. ludicra : either the plur. of ‘ ludi-
crum‚' a frequent word in Livy for a
show of games, or the nent. plur. of the
adj„ a more general term than ‘ ludos,’
‘public games and all that concerns
them.' We must remember the large
space occupied by spectacles in the aims
and dreams of a Roman. The words
have been punctuated and taken in many
ways. Aer. interprets by ‘inania‚‘ but
there is nothing to show whether he
took it as in apposition or agreement
with ‘munera,' ‘mere playthings,' or
with ‘ plausus‚' the latter being a geni-
tive, ‘empty applause.’ The objection
to these seems valid that a contemptuous

epithet spoils the rhetorical force of the
question, still more when it is affixed to
part only of the objects of the sentence.
plausus et dona. are to be taken to-
gether as both governing ⁴ Quiritis.'

Quiritis, properly a single Roman
citizen (as in Od. 2. 7. 3). Here used
collectively for the Romans, as ‘ Ro-
manus ' in A. P. 54; with ‘dona Quiritis,’
cp. Juv. S. 10. 78 ‘ qui [populus] dabat
olim Imperium, fasces, legiones, omnia.’

9. fere, best taken with eodem, as
in Sat. 1. 3. 96 with ‘paria,’ (see note
therei ‘ the same or nearly so.'

miratur : he breaks the rule ζ nil ad—
mirari.’ It is well translated by Prof.
wilkins ‘ overesteems.’

10. cupiens, ‘the man who desires
them.'

pavor, in the sense of Virgil's ‘ pavor
pulsans ' G. 3. 106, A. 5. 138, ‘the flutter
of excitement.' ‘ There is the flutter of
heart which is painsul in either case, so
soon as a sight that was not looked for
amazes the one and the other.'

11. exterret is used much as in Virg.
A. 11. 806 ‘ exterritus Arruns Laetitia
mixtoque metu‚' of the amazement of
strong emotion. There seems no need,
in spite of Lachmann’s authority (on
Lucr. 4. 1022, where he adopted the
same verb), to accept the conj. of Jacobs
(Lect. Venus.) ‘ externat ' (a verb
analogous in formation and sense to
‘ consternare ³).

12. The same sourfold division of
emotions as Virg. A. 6. 733.

13. spe, ‘expectationss

14. ‘ Eyes are riveted, and heart and
limbs alike spellbound.' With ‘ torpet ’
cp. Sat. 2. 7. 95 n.
