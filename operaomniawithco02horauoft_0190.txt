178 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE VI.

COUNTRY LIFE AND TOWN LIFE.

Verses 1—5. IN my Sabine farm Ι have got just what Ι longed sor; and more than
that, Ι have nothing more to ask for.

6-15. My prayers are the acceptable prayers of honesty, sobemess, and content-
ment.

16—19. Here then is the first theme for my satiric muse, my happy mountain home,
and the contrast with the vexations and dangers of the city.

20-26. Janus, god of the morning as of all beginnings, let us record a day in
Rome from its beginning. First you summon me in hot haste, in any weather,
to give surety for a friend.

27-31. XYhen that dangerous business is over I have to fight my way through the
streets. ‘ What are you about,’ eries angrily one whom I have jostled, ‘in such
a hurry to keep an engagement again with Maecenas? '

32—39. Ay, there is the sweetening of town life to me, but I cannot even go to
Maecenas' house in peace. As Ι get near it one waylays me to remind me
that Roscius claims my attendanee in the Forum to-morrow. Another that the
scribes want me to-day. Another desires 'Maecenas’ signature and Ι must
get it for him. If I promise to do my best he thinks Ι am putting him off.

40-49. That is the way with my friendship for Maecenas. All these (nearly) eight
years it has been misundmstood, the object of remark and of envy.

50-58. I am catechized about state secrets, and thought a wonderful man sor not
revealing what I do not know.

59—67. So a day is wasted in Rome. What wonder if Ι sigh for the country, for
my books, my siesta‚ my simple supper :

67-76. amongst friends and home-bred slaves, no ceremony, no gossip, but talk

on things of moment, the nature of happiness, the grounds of friendship, the
end of life.

hits the point. For instance, if any one is rash enough to speak admiringly
of the wealth of Arellius, he will tell the fable of the town mouse and the
country mouse.

The Satire is of great importance in fixing the chronology of Horace's life and
writings. If it can be dated itself it fixes (v. 40) the date of his admission to
Maecenas' intimacy, and so gives a starting-point for dating most of the Satires of
Book Ι. Three indications of date seem to be given in the Satire, in vv. 38 and
55, 56. For their full discussion see Introduction to the Satires, pp. 2-4.
