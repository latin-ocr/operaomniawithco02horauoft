HORATII EPISTULARUM

Nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri,

Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes. 15
Nunc agilis fio et mersor civilibus undis,

Virtutis verae custos rigidusque satelles3

Nunc in Aristippi furtim praecepta relabor, ¹

Et mihi res, non me rebus subiungere conor.

Ut nox longa quibus mentitur amica, diesque ⁷ s ,γ ’Ᾰ 20 ¹

Longa videtur opus debentibus, ut piger annus
Pupillis quos dura premit custodia matrum3

Sic mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora, quae spem

to the metaphor os the last of the two
substantives.

14. addictus: properly of a debtor
who has been by sentence of court given
over for the time as slave to his creditor;
then used metaphorically, as Cic. Tusc.
2. 2. 5 ‘ qui certis quibusdam desti-
natisque sententiis addicti et consecrati
sunt.'

iurare in verba. Cp. Epod. 15. 4
‘ in verba iurabas inea ’ ; to swear after a
formula dictated. lt was specially used
of the military oath of allegiance, as in
Liv. 28. 29 ‘in verba P. Scipionis iu-
rarunt.' Here however the reference is
to the oath of obedienee taken hy those
who engaged themselves as gladiators;
‘ magistri³ being a title of the ‘lanista'
or trainer of a gladiatorial school
(Cic. de Or. 3. 23. 86 ‘magister Samni-
tium⁷). See Mayor on Juv. S. 11. 8 ‘leges
et regia verba lanistae,’ and cp. Hor.
Sat. 2. 7. 58 ‘uri, virgis ferroque necari,
Auctoratus.' ‘ Addictus ³ here takes the
place of ‘ auctoratus ’ (‘ having hired
himself out ³). The inf. in both cases is
of the class discussed in Appendix 2
(ξ 2) of vol. 1.

15. deferor hospeS, ‘ 1 come to land
and claim hospitality.' The metaphor
is a natural one, but cp. Cic. Acad.
Prior. 2. 8 ‘ ad quamcunque sunt dis-
ciplinam quasi tempestate delati?

16. agilis: Epp. 1. 18. 90 ‘agilem
gnavumque ’ ; ‘ a man osaction.' Cicero,
de Fin. 3. 20. 68, quotes Chrysippus as
teaching the Stoic doctrine that the wise
man should take part in public life,
‘ velit gerere et administrare rempub-
licam.'

civilibus undis: Epp. 2. 2. 84 ‘ re-
rum fluctibus in mediis.'

17. verae: true to its standard, not
lowered to suit men’s weakness.

custos rigidusque satelles. ‘Rigi-
dus’ belongs to both substantives and is
outside the metaphor, describing other-
wise the strictness of the true Stoic:
‘eustos,' ‘satelles,⁷ as though Virtue
were a sovereign.

IS. Aristippi: Sat. 2. 3. 100, Epp.
1. 17. 14, 23 ; the founder of the Cyrenaic
school, who ‘ voluptatem finem esse
voluerunt ⁷ Cic. Acad. Prior. 42. 131.

furtim relabor, as though he was
ashamed of it. Horace does not paint
this eclecticism as an ideal. He is in
search of a philosophica] system. This
hesitation is a proof that he has not
attained it.

19. ‘Try to make things serve me,
not myself serve them.' A general de-
scription of his own attitude towards
externa] things in his Epicurean mo-
ments. He finds the principles of his
lise in his own inclinations‚ not in mles,
claims, relations outside himself.

21. opus debentibus, ‘whose work
is a matter os debt.⁷ A man who is
working for his own pleasure or advant-
age finds the day too short.

22. pupillis . . . custodia. The
former is a technical word, the latter not.
The boys are orphans and therefore
‘pupilli,' ‘wards ’ of some guardian,
‘tutor‚' appointed under the father's
will. They live still with their mother
and are therefore under her control, in
fact, though not in law, as a woman
could not be a ‘tutor ³.

dura, ‘ irksome.’

24. id quod, ete.‚ i. e. the obtaining
of fixed principles of conduct.
