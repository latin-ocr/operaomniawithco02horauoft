HORATII EPISTULARUM

Scriptores trutina, non est quod multa loquamur: 30
Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri3

Venimus ad summum fortunae3 pingimus atque

Psallimus et luctamur Achivis doctius unctis,

Si meliora dies ut vina poemata reddit,

Scire velim, chartis pretium quotus arroget annus. 35
Scriptor abhinc annos centum qui decidit, inter

Perfectos veteresque referri debet, an inter

Viles atque novos?

Excludat iurgia finis.

‘Est vetus atque probus centum qui perficit annos?

Quid, qui deperiit minor uno mense vel anno, 40
Inter quos referendus erit? veteresne poetas,

An quos et praesens et postera respuat aetas?

‘Iste quidem veteres inter ponetur honeste,

30. non est quod multa loquamur:
there is no need to say much, i. e. the
conclusion is obvious.

31. oleam. Bentley would read ‘olea‚'
understanding ‘in’ tas with ‘cum' in
v. 25), and Keller approves, though
allowing that ‘ oleam' was the reading
of the archetype, and was found by
Porph.

32. ad summum fortunae. ‘We
have attained all that is possible to
human nature; we can beat the Greeks
at their accomplishments.' Achivis
doctius unctis shows that this is said
with some irony, as though he had
added ‘as much as we can in our own
more solid excellences.’

35. quotus, ‘which in the series2'
the moth? the 99th? etc. Tacitus in
Dial. de Or. 16 puts the same answer
into the mouth of Afer, when he is
meeting a sweeping assertion of the
superiority of ancient orators.

arroget: the sense of ‘to claim‚'

common in other writers and found in
Sat. 2. 4. 35, A. P. 122, seems in this
place, as in Od. 4. 14. 40, less appro-
priate. We want rather ‘to add,’ ‘to
assign further.' This may be an exten-
sion of the recognized use, or may come
by a different channel from some tech-
nical use of ‘arrogost Orelli suggests
the use for formal adoption by a ‘lex
curiata ’; Mr. Page the analogy of ‘pro-
rogare,’ ‘ to grant in extensiou.’

36. decidit: Od. 4. 7. 14.

37. Note the mockery in the repeated

coupling ‘perfectos veteresque,' ‘viles
atque ῐιονοε,7 and also in the order in
each case, the questioner professing to
put the ‘ perfectiori ’ or ‘ worthlessness'
as the characteristic which strikes the
mind first. This is made evident by
the reversal of the order in the answer
which is meant to be plain matter of
fact, yet equally to assume that age and
worth go together.

38. excludat iurgia finis: let us
have a limit to bar disputes, like Vir-
gil's landmark, ‘Limes agro positus
litem ut discerneret arvis' Aen. 12. 897.

41, 4²· The questioner here expresses
the convertibility of old and good, new
and bad, not as before by coupling the
terms, but by opposing ‘old' in one
clause to a vehement expression for
⁴ bad' in the other. Bentley seems to
have missed this when he wished to
read ‘ probosque' for poetas. His
further reason against the text, viz.
the ὁμοιοτέλευτον ‘poetas,’ ‘aetas‚⁷ is
answered by reference to A. P. 99, 100;
1³6, 1*- .

143. ίΞ-Χγ, call him old, by favour of
the court, who falls a month or e'en
a twelvemonth short.’ So Conington
translates, rightly indicating that (as in
v. 59) there is the affectation of a sen-
tentious tone as of a judge allowing a
point. Cp. the answers of Trebatius in
Sat. 2. 1.

honeste. As this is the equivalent
to ‘Est vetus atque probus’ ot' v. 39,
ponetur honeste probably means ‘shall
