LIB. 1.

Compositum melius cum Bitho Bacchius.

SAT. 7.

In ius 20

Acres procurrunt, magnum spectaculum uterque.
Persius exponit causam; ridetur ab omni
Conventu3 laudat Brutum laudatque cohortem:
Solem Asiae Brutum appellat, stellasque salubres
Appellat comites, excepto Rege; canem illum

Invisum agricolis sidus venisse.

Ruebat

Flumen ut hibernum fertur quo rara securis.

Tum Praenestinus salso multoque fluenti

Expressa arbusto regerit convicia, durus

Vindemiator et invictus, cui saepe viator 30
Cessisset magna compellans voce cucullum.

At Graecus, postquam est Italo perfusus aceto,

Persius exclamat: ‘Per magnos, Brute, deos te

uti, consecutive to ‘par’=‘ita par,'
‘ a pair so well matched that‚’ etc.

20. compositum, sc. ‘parf Some
MSS. have ‘ compositus’ or ‘compositi,'
both apparently corrections. We may
understand ‘ sit ’ or better ‘ pugnet⁷ ;
for ⁴ compositum ' see on Sat. 1. 1. 103.

in ius. As ‘ vocare in ius' Sat.
1. 9. 77, 2. 5. 29, ‘ rapere' 2. 3. 72.

22. ridetur, best taken impersonally,
¹ a laugh is raised.'

23· conventu: ‘the court.' ‘ Con-
ventus’ was the technical term for the
courts held by a proconsul or pro-
praetor in the chief towns of a pro-
vmce.

cohor-tem. Epp. 1. 3. 6, 1. 8. 14;
the staff or personal surrounding of the
eommander or provincial governor ε
‘cohors praetoria' Cic. Verr. 2. 1. 14.
They were also called individually
‘comites' Epp. 1. 8. 2.

27. fertur quo rara, i. e. in some
steep ravine.

28. salso multoque fluenti, ‘in an—
swer to his copious stream oswit.' With
‘multo fluenti ’ cp. Virg. Georg. 3. 28.
It is a Greek usage, τῷ Πύθωνι θρασυνο-
μένῳ naz πολλῷ ῥέοντι Dem. de Cor. p.
²7²· ‘Multo,⁷ which is the reading
of the best MSS„ was restored to
the text by Bentley, in the place of
‘multum.'

29. expressa arbusto, ‘forced, ex-
torted, from the vineyard.’ Rupilius
is like one of his native Italian vine-
dressers, hard to sting by taunts, but
when he is stung, the master of a sup-
ply of retorts which few can stand up
against.

30. vindemiator: for the scansion,
see Od. 3. 4. 41, 3. 6. 6; Sat. 2. 8. 1
‘ ut Nasidieni!

3¹· cessisset, ‘was likely to have
yielded.' The time of the leading
clause is really historic, isit were present
it would be ‘ cesserit.‘

magna, ete., however loud the voice
in which he had called ‘ cuckoo, cuckoo?
‘ Calling cuckoo ’ is explained by Pliny,
N. H. 18. 66, ‘taunting men engaged in
dressing their vines hy imitating the
note ol* a bird of passage called the
euekoo: for it is held a disgrace that
when that bird returns it should find a
pruning-hook still at work in the vine!
Cp. the picture in Auson. Mosella, 165
‘inde viator Riparum subiecta terenS,
hinc navita labens, Probra canunt seris
cultoribus?

32. Note the contrast implied in
the emphatic Graecus, Italo. The
characteristics of the Italian’s retorts are
kept up in perfusus, ‘ drenehed,’
‘soused‚’ and aceto, recalling the
figure os the ‘vindemiator‚' the kind of
humour coarse and plentiful with which
the Romans were familiar in the ‘ fabulae
Atellanae.’
