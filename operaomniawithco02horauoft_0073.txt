34—38. Starting again they pass through Fundi, where the chief magistrate is ful—
some and consequential, and aster a long day reach Formiae, where they sleep
at a house belonging to Murena, Maeeenas' brother-⁸ --111 law, Capito (who
probably also had a villa' there) finding cook and dinner.

39—46. On the fitth day, as they pass through Sinuessa, Plotius Tucca, virgil,
and Varius' Join them. They sleep at a ‘villulas on the border of Latium and

Campania.

47-49. On the sixth day they reach Capua early.

50—70. The seventh night is spent at Coeceius’ ‘villa ' beyond Caudium. [They
are now beginning to cross the Appennines.] Here the amusement os the
evening is described, the encounter of the two ‘scurrae’

71—85. On the eighth day they reach Beneventum in the upper valley of the
Vulturnus. [From this point the Via Appia proceeds through Venusia to
Tarentum and from thence to Brundisium. Maecenas and 1115 party go by
a cross road which diverges from this and makes more directly for the
N. coast] The night is spent at a ‘villa' near Trivicum. On the road
they have been catehing sight of the hill outlines of Horace's old neighbour-

hood.

86-93. They have now crossed the pass and descend rapidly (tenth day) to a
little town with a name intractable for hexameter verse, and which cannot
be identified. The eleventh day takes them to Canusium, where Varius leaves

them.

Barium. We are now on the coast. The fourteenth and fifteenth to Egnatia

EGRESSUM magna me accepit Aricia Roma
Hospitio modico; rhetor comes Heliodorus,

Graecorum longe doctissimus;

1. aceepit, ‘welcomed‚’ Sat. 2. 6.
81, Virg.Aen. 3. 78. The verb is specially
used with ‘hospitio.' as Cicv ad Att.
2. 15. 4. Some good MSS. have ‘exee-
pit;’ cp. Liv. 38. 41 ‘postero die Pria-
ticus campus eos excepit.' If we retain
‘accepit,' the fact that Aricia was the
‘first stopping-place ⁶ is left to ‘egres-
sum . . . Roma,' and the emphasis is laid
entirely on the contrast ‘magna‚' ‘mo-
dico‚’ the exchange of the splendours of
Rome for the first experience of a
country inn.

Aricia. Virg. Aen. 7. 762 foll.‚Juv.S.
4. 1¹7 (Mayor, n.), Cic. Phil. 3. 6. 15. A
town sixteen miles from Rome, one mile
and a half beyond the modern Albano.
The present town ofLariccia, which is on
the hill, covers the site of the ancient
cstadel, Aricia itself having lain in the
valley to which the ‘Via Appia’ de-
scended by the ‘clivus Aricinusss the
haunt of beggars, Juv 1. c. and Pers. 6.

inde Forum Appi,

2. Heliodorus: otherwise unknown.
He has been identified by some with
a writer on metre much praised by
Marius Victorinus (fourth cent.) ‘inter
Graecos huiusce artis antistes aut primus
aut solus? For another conjectural
identification see introd. to Od. 3. 19.

3. Graecorum longe doctissimus.
Some good MSS. have ‘linguaess but
the Schol. had ‘ longe ’3 ‘linguae' may
have been due to Od. 3. 8. 5 ‘docte
sermones utriusque linguae‚’ and to
a sense of hyperbole in ‘Graecorum
longe.’ ‘ Graecorum ’ to Horace would
be almost equivalent to ‘rhetorum et
grammaticorum‚‘ but the hyperbole is
intended and is playful.

Forum Appi. Cic. ad Att. 2. 10.
There, as in St. Paul's journey to Rome
(Acts 28. 151, it is mentioned in con-
junction with‘ Tres Tabernae as among
the stopping- places on the Via Appia
The ruins still exist at the forty- -third
milestone from Ixome.
