350 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Mox etiam pectus praeceptis format amicis,
Asperitatis et invidiae corrector et irae3

Recte facta refert, orientia tempora notis

Instruit exemplis, inopem solatur et aegrum.
Castis cum pueris ignara puella mariti

Disceret unde preces, vatem ni Musa dedisset?
Poscit opem chorus et praesentia numina sentit,
Caelestes implorat aquas docta prece blandus,
Avertit morbos, metuenda pericula pellit,
Impetrat et pacem et locupletem frugibus annum.
Carmine di superi placantur, carmine Manes.
Agricolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati,

Condita post frumenta levantes tempore festo
Corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,
Cum sociis operum pueris et coniuge fida,
Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,

in those tender years poetry has in a
negative and indireet way a moral in-

fluence in giving the ear a bias against

coarse subjects and ways of speaking;
presently it directly educates the heart
by the precepts and examples which
it conveys. The particles may be com-
pared with Od. 4. 4. 5 foll. ‘iam,’ ‘m0x‚’
‘nunc‚' of the stages in the eaglet's
education.

130. orientia tempora. ‘Each new
time as it arises'; the figure, half eon-
scious, is perhaps that of a star, the
antithesis is with notis; poetry is a
>link between the generations, preserv-
ing the experience of one to be the
guide of the next.

131. inopem solatur et aegrum.
Ritter is probably right in taking these
words as qualified, like ‘instruit’ by
‘ notis exemplis.' The way that poetry
is to solace men in distress and sore-
ness of heart, is by showing them
illustrious examples of endurance and
deliverance. Horace is no doubt at-
tributing to the poet the offices usually
claimed for the philosopher; but he has
told usin Epp. 1. 2 how he discharges
those offiees.

132 soll. Cp. Od. 1. 21, 4. 6. 29—44,
and the whole of the Carm. Sec.

139 soll. We resume the main sub-
ject in a sketch of the growth of Latin
poetry from a rustic origin, the traces
of which lingered long, yielding gra-
dually to Greek influence, which was
not brought to bear till late. This
proves the unreasonableness of an in-
discriminating preference for the ancient
pocts. Cp. the account of the origin
of Latin dramatic poetry given in Virg.
Georg. 2. 385 foll.

Virgil's ‘ patiens operam exiguoque
assueta iuventus’ Georg. 2. 472.

141. spe finis dura ferentem de-
scribes their temper, not at this moment
when the end has come, but during the
toil that has preceded it.

142. His sons and his wife shared
the labour (Sat. 2. 2. 115, Epod. 2. 39)
and so share the relaxation.
