EPIST. 17.

303

Quid, qui pervenit, fecitne viriliter? Atqui

Hic est aut nusquam quod quaerimus.

Hic onus horret,

Ut parvis animis et parvo corpore maius: 40

Hic subit et perfert.

Aut virtus nomen inane est,

Aut decus et pretium recte petit experiens vir.
Coram rege suo de paupertate tacentes
Plus poscente ferent3 distat sumasne pudenter

An rapias.

Atqui rerum caput hoc erat, hic fons. 45

‘Indotata mihi soror est, paupercula mater,
Et fundus nec vendibilis nec pascere firmus‚'

Qui dicit, clamat, ‘Victum date?

would Ι climb, but that I fear to fall.'
“If thy heart fail thee, do not climb
at all.’

ne non succederet: the impersonal
and absolute use, as Cic. Or. 28. 98 ‘ si
quando minus succedet.'

esto : ‘ Wcll.' ‘ Perhaps he is right?
It is, in short, a repetition of vv. 640.

38. ‘Tell me, the man who has made
his way there, in spite of the obstacles‚
think you, he has shown manly energy? ³
‘ Sedit’ (has stayed at home) and
pervenit keep up the figure of v. 36.

fecitne; see on Epp. 1. 16. 31. Both
passages may be added to the instances
collected by Kiihner on Cic. Tusc. D. 2.
11. 26 of ‘ ne?⁷ used where we rather
expect ‘nonne?’ He points out that
it is sometimes used, in a similar way,
for ‘num’; the explanation in both cases
being (as with ἆρα for ἆρ’ οὗ) that the
question is purposely put as if it were
an open one, with the effect (as in
other cases os ironica] λιτότης) of giving
stronger, not weaker, emphasis to the
true nature of the answer expected. See
also Heindorf on Sat. 2. 7. 61, and
Mayor on Juv. S. 10. 28. Cp. also the use
of ‘ecquid sentis?' in Epp. 1. 18. 82.

39. hic, sc. ‘in viriliter faciendo!

quod quaerimus. He is speaking
of the quest on which he supposes him-
self and the readers of his Epistles to
be engaged (see Epp. 1. Ι. 24—26, etc.),
viz. for the true principle of life.

41. aut virtus nomen: cp. Epp.
1. 6. 31 ‘ virtutem verba putas? Horace
seems to be arguing or playing on the
etymology of ‘virtus’ as he does in
other places. Cp. notes on Epod. 15.
11, 16. 39. ‘ What is “virtus '' if it is
not “viriliter facere‚'' if it is not the
quality of the “ experiens vir '’ ? ’

Succinit alter :

42. recte petit, ‘is rightly seeking‚'
deserving.

experiens vir, ὁ πειρώμενος (ἐς Τροίαν
πειρώμενοι ἧνθον Ἀχαιοί Theoc. 15. 61) ;
cp. Cic. Clu. 8. 23 ‘vir sortis et ex-
periens' ; enterprising. But there is an
emphasis here on ·' vir,’ ‘ one who tries
as a man should.’ See note on v.
41.

43 soll. Horace turns abruptly to some
practical precepts for keeping a patron's
favour ; the two chosen must be intended
to contrast satirically with Scaeva’s pre-
viously supposed scruples.

rege suo. For ‘rex’ of a patron
cp. Epp. Ι. 7. 37. Munro follows Bentl.
in reading ‘sua,' but on slight MS.
authority.

45. atqui, etc. ‘Yet this was the
very fount and source of everything,' i.e.
the very essence of the whole business
with which we started was to get all you
ean.

hoo goes back to ‘ plus poscente
ferent,⁷ the intervening words being
parenthetical.

erat. The impft. refers to the time
when the motives of seeking a patron
were considered, i. e. in vv. 11, 12. It
is hardly idiomatic in the sense of the
note on Od. Ι. 37. 4.

46. indotata. The father is dead
and the brother feels it a disgrace that
he cannot provide a dower. The edd.
quote Plaut. Trin. 3. 2. 63.

paupercula 2 the diminutive expresses
pity, as ‘ misellus.'

47. A farm which we can neither sell
nor live by. For pascere firmus see
App. 2.vol. 1.

48. clamat, ‘Victum date,’ is like
a common beggar3 the thought is kept
up in the next line.
