LIB. I.

SAT. 8.

Maluit esse deum. Deus inde ego furum aviumque
Maxima formid03 nam fures dextra coercet ι
Obscenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus; 5
Ast importunas volucres in vertice arundo

Terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis.

Huc prius angustis eiecta cadavera cellis

Conservus vili portanda locabat in arca.

Hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum, ιο
Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque nepoti:

Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum

Hic dabat: Heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.

Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque

Aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes 15

divinity—‘ and so a god 1 am.' It may
be compared with the more serious
irony of Isaiah 44. 10 soll. ‘He bui-neth
part thereos in the fire, with the part
thereof he eateth flesh . . . and the resi-
due thereos he maketh a god.’

4. fures dextra ; his hand should be
uplisted and hold, as the Schol. says a
club or a sickle, as in Virg. G. 4. 110
‘custos furum atque avium cum falce
saligna Hellespontiaci servet tutela
Priapi?

6. arundo has been taken, as by Orelli,
of a wisp of reeds that would rattle in
the wind and so frighten birds ; but the
meaning seems to be fixed by Prop. 4. 2.
33 (a poem which has several links with
this Satire* where Vertumnus describ—
ing, like Priapus, the various adomments
of his own image, says ‘arundine sumpta
Fautor plumoso sum deus aucupio;'
‘ arundo ⁷ being used in a well recognized
sense of a limed twig.

8. cellis. Cic. Plnl. 2. 27. 67 ‘ servo-
rum in cellis.’ Every word adds to the
sense of ignominy, ‘angus-tis, eiecta z ’
mean as are their quarters they are
no sooner dead than their ‘cadavera'
are tossed out from them; such bun'al
as they receive they owe only to a fellow
slave's compassion; it is the cheapest
bier.

1 1. ‘ It is the fate to which the worth-
less and the brokendown come.’ The
line is quoted as a specimen of Horace's
personal satire in Sat. 2. 1. 22, but
the names are evidently fictitious and
literary. ‘ Nomentanus,' as we have
seen ‘on Sat. 1. 1. 103, is the conventional

spendthrift of Satire, a name inherited
from Lucilius. Pantolabus is a name
coined for the character as the Schol.
sees ‘ quia a multis pecuniam accipiebat
inde Pantolabus dictus.’

12. in fronte, in agrum, ‘ frontage‚'
‘ depth? The dimensions are meant liter-
ally, but the cippus and its inscrip-
tion is probably imaginary aud ironical,
being borrowed from the provisions of a
private burying-ground and equivalent
to saying ‘it was the private burying-
ground of the very lowest, which no one
would rob them of.’ They are all
technical terms and occur in monumental
inscriptions. The last words were in-
tended to reserve the ground for the
specified purpose3 it was not to pass, like
the rest of the property, to the heirs of
the original proprietor. They are more
sully explained in an inser. preserved by
Lambinus, ‘ita ne unquam de nomine
familiae nostrae exeat hoc monumentum,
hoc monumentum heredes non sequitur)

13. dabat, i. e. ‘ recorded the gift.'

ne sequeretur, the tense because he
is quoting what was the <supposed> in-
scription.

14. salubribus, pred. = ‘ salubribus
factis.’

15. aggere, prob. the ‘agger' of
Servius Tullius, from which men would
look over the Campus Esquilinus, and
which would therefore be now a
pleasanter lounge than it had been.
Juvenal S. 8. 43 calls it ‘ ventosus,⁷ the
place whither the Romans resorted to
catch the wind as well as the sun.
