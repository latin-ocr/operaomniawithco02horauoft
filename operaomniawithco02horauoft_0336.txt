HORATII EPISTULARUM

Temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit quem versibus oblinat atris, 30
Nec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.

Hunc ego, non alio dictum prius ore, Latinus

Volgavi fidicen3 iuvat immemorata serentem

Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector 35
Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus:

these lines. Horace is pleadiug against
the charge that he had shown servility
in adhering to the metre and poetical
form (ί carminis artem Ἴ of Archilochus.
The Scholiast supposed him to answer,
⁴ Though I did not alter the measures of
Archilochus, Ι mingled with them those
of Sappho and Alcaeus, persons of very
different tone.' The insuperable objec-
tion to this lies, not only in the difficulty
of sed, which, as Bentley argued,
should in that case be rather ‘ et‚' but in
the irrelevance of vv. 29⁴31 ‘sed . . .
nectit⁷; for in this interpretation ‘ Al-
caeus' is not the poet himself but the
Alcaic Odes in Horace, and therefore
these lines are only a repetition and ex-
pansion of what has been already said
in v. 25 ‘non res et agentia verba
Lycamben) Bentley first suggested the
view which has been generally taken
since, that Horace's answer is, ‘ Ι am
only doing what Sappho and Alcaeus
did before me. They used Archilochus’
metres, though they departed tas I do)
widely from his subjects and purpose.'
The accidental fragments which we
possess of Alcaeus and Sappho hardly
explain the statement that they employed
the metres of Archilochus, but neither
are they enough to show that Horace
did not make it.

28. temperat. The metaphor sug-
gested is of mixing a cup. Construct
‘ Archilochi pede . . . Musam (suam).’

mascula: the poetess a match for
the poets.

29. rebus et ordine dispar. The
general meaning is clear. Alcaeus,
though borrowing metres from Archi-
lochus, showed his independence in
everything else. The exact meaning of
· ordine’ is less easy to catch. Bentley
takes it of metrical arrangement, re-
ferring as an example to the substitution
by Alcaeus of a Dactylic hexameter for
the Iambic trimeter in the couplet

known among Horatian metres as
⁴ Archilochium Ι·ΞΓΙ ’ (see Index of Metres
in vol. 1. App. 3. ᾖ 6Ὗ. This is perhaps
inconsistent with the purpose of the
appeal to Alcaeus and Sappho, namely
as precedents for exact imitation of
metre combined with freedom of matter.
If we had the poems referred to, it may
be, ‘subjects and arrangement' would
explain itself more definitely.

30. quaerit, ‘ select.’ Horace is
shocked at the turning of the sting of
the lampoons on near relations, His
conscience would not be troubled sor
Canidia and other personal objects of
his own Epodes.

31. famoso: Sat. 2. Ι. 68.

32. hune, sc. ‘Alcaeum '; ‘he is the
model I am most proud of being the
first to follow.‘ Alcaeus is named singly,
although the general spirit of the pass-
age implies that he has imitated Sappho
also, not so much because Catullus had
essayed the Sapphic metre (which pos-
sibly Horace would have ignored as he
has Catullus' iambics, see on v. 24) as
because he is thinking chiefly of the in·
spiration whieh he caught from the
‘citizen poet' (Od. 1. 32. 5). There
seems a definite reference in vv. 33, 34
to the stately political Odes at the be-
ginning of Book 3, which he professes
to address as ‘ non prius audita . . . Vir-
ginibus puerisque’ Od. 3. 1. 1-4. These
are the 'gentle eyes and hands ' of this
passage.
