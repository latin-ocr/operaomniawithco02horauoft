Id tibi iudicium est, ea mens.

Scripseris, in Maeci descendat iudicis aures
Et patris et nostraS, nonumque prematur in annum,

Membranis intus positis:
Quod non edideris;

Silvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum
Caedibus et victu foedo deterruit Orpheus,
Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rabidosque leones;
Dictus et Amphion, Thebanae conditor arcis,

386. olim, ‘some day';
137, and see on Epod. 3. 1.

387. Maeci iudicis: identified by
the Scholiasts with the ‘Taipa iudex'
of Sat. 1. 10. 3S; see note there. He
stands here for an experienced critic;
‘ descendat in aures ’ implies ata private
reading. This reference to Maecius
(see Introd. p. 332) has been used
as an argument for the earlier date
of the poem. Bentley took the words
as not implying that Maecius was still
alive; ‘ some Maecius as a critic.'

388. nonum prematur in annum.
The meaning is well given by Quintilian
10. 4. 2 ‘Nec dubium est optimum
emendandi genus, si scripta in aliquod
tempus reponuntur ut ad ea post inter-
vallum velut nova atque aliena redea-
mus, ne nobis scripta nostra tanquam
recentes fetus blandiantur.’ So in his
dedicatory letter he says of himself as
having followed the advice of Horace,
‘ qui in arte poetica suadet ne praecipi-
tetur editio) The Scholiasts imagine
a reference to the story (Catull. 94. 1)
of Cinnas spending nine years on his
Zmyrna, but this is not exactly what
Horace recommends.

389. membranis: see on Sat. 2. 3.
2; parchment was used apparently sor
the author's ¹ fair copy.’

390. vox missa: cp. Epp. 1. 20. 6
‘ Non erit emisso reditus tibi?

391—407. ‘Poetry had always a high
calling, to civilize, to inspirit, to help
and solace; you need not be ashamed
of its Cp. the account of the uses of
the poet in Epp. 2. 1. 124. The pur-
pose now is to reinforce the plea which

he is urging for making the composition
of poetry a serious business,

391. silvestres homines. For Ho-
race's picture of the savage state cp.
Sat. 1. 3. 99f.

sacer: Aer. quotes Virgil's descrip‹
tion of Orpheus Aen. 6. 6145( Threicius
longa cum veste sacerdosf

393. rabidosque: the epithet be-
lon ging to both substantives ; see on
Ο(]. 1. 30. 6. ‘ Rabidos’ is the reading of
V and B: the majority of other MSS.
have ‘rapidos' which Keller defends.
The same question arises in Lucr. 4. 712
‘ leones,⁷ 5. 840 ‘ canes ’ς but Lachmann
and Munro read in each case ‘ rabidi '3
see also Conington on Virg. G. 2. 151.

393-394. dictus . . . dietus, both
emphatic. The repeated word links
together the two legends, which he
rationalizes into expression of the civiliz-
ing power of poetry. For Amphion see
Od. 3. 11. 2.

395. blanda: cp. Od. 1. 12.11.

396. fuit haee sapientia. ‘They (the
poets) were the philosophers of those
early times, when philosophy meant the
first Iessons of civilization.’ Cp. Cicero's
address to philosophy, Tusc. D. 5. 2. 5
‘ Tu urbes peperisti, tu dissipatos homi-
nes in societatem vitae convocasti, tu
eos inter se primo domiciliis, deinde
coniugiis, tum litterarum et vocum com-
munione iunxisti, tu inventrix legum,
tu magistra morum et disciplinae fuisti. ’

397. publica privatis secernere:
that· is, to institute private property.

sacra profanis: eontrast ‘miscebis

sacra profanis' Epp 1. 16. 54.
