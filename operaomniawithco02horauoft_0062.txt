HORATII SATIRARUM

Ut magnum, versus dictabat stans pede in uno. 10
Cum flueret lutulentus erat quod tollere velles;
Garrulus atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

Scribendi recte: nam ut multum, nil moror.

Ecce,

Crispinus minimo me provocat: ‘ Accipe, si vis,

Accipiam tabulas3 detur nobis locus, hora, 15
Custodes; videamus uter plus scribere possit.’

Di bene fecerunt inopis me quodque pusilli

Finxerunt animi, raro et perpauca loquentis:

10. dictabat, Epp. 2. 1. 110, as to
an amanuensis; but it takes its place
⁴ side by side with ‘ scribere ' (see vv. 12,
13), as a verb describing literary com-
position, without special consideration
at the moment of the method used.

stans pede in uno: probably ex-
plained as a proverbial expression mean—
ing ¹ as an easy thing,⁷ something that
you could do without needing both feet.
Schutz illustrates by Terence's ‘ manibus
pedibusque obnixe facturum’ Andr. 1.
1. 134, and Prof. Palmer still more ap-
positely from Quintil. 12. 9. 18 ‘in
his actionibus omni, ut agricolae dicunt,
pede standum est.’

11. eum flueret, ‘as he flowed along
in a muddy stream3' for metaph. cp.
Od. 4. 2. 5-8.

tollere‚as ‘tollenda ’ in Sat. 1. 10. 50,
‘ to remove? The Scholiasts took these
words strangely, making ‘ cum ’ ε
‘although,' and ‘ tollere’z‘ excipere, et
pro tuis habere.⁷ Heindorf and Ritter
follow them. Orelli points out how
incongruously this verse would be placed
if, as this interpretation implies, it con-
tains praise. Quintilian’s interpretation
settles the point if it was doubtful, 10. Ι.
94 ‘Ego ab Horatio dissentio qui Lu-
cilium fluere lutulentum et esse aliquid
quod tollere possis putat.'

12. piger ferre. App. ΙΙ. vol. i., p.

80.

3 13. ut multum, sc. ‘scriberet‚’ ‘sor
his writing a quantity Ι care not at all.'
‘ Nil moror ' more commonly is followed
by ace. and inf.

14. Crispinus : cp. on Sat. 1. 1. 120.

minimo me provocat. Porph. ex-
plains this by a proverbial expression,
‘ minimo digito provocare‚’ which he
vouches for as existent in his own time
(‘ solemus dicere ¹) with the meaning
‘to challenge contemptuously3' ‘cum

volumus quem intelligi tantum valere
minimo digito quantum alium viribus.’
Aer. repeats this, but adds the alter-
native explanation, ‘ Minimo provocare
dicuntur hi qui in sponsione tin laying a.
wager) plus ipsi promittunt quam exi-
gant ab adversario,' so that the constr.
would be as ⁶ sponsique provocare‚‘ and
the sense ‘offers ene long odds.’ It
would seem, in spite ofthe definiteness of
their statements, that both Scholiasts
were feeling their way to an explanation
of a difficult phrase, and in that case
we can hardly be more confident. No
fresh light has been thrown on it.
Bentley wished to read ‘nummo' for
‘ minimo ' (a confusion of writing found
elsewhere), ‘ would lay me a sesterce‚'
i. e. (as he explains) such a sum as his
poverty allows.

15. accipiam. The older MSS. are
divided between this reading and “Accipe
iam ’ as though Crispinus were becoming
more and more urgent. V. had ‘ aeci-
piam.'

17. inopis quodque pusilli=‘ quod
inopis pusillique,' etc. See note on Od.
1. 30. 6. There is a good note on the
subject in Dissen's Tibullus on 1. 1. 51.

inopis, of want of ideas.

pusilli, of want of spirit, so that
perhaps they answer in inverse order to
‘ raro‚' ‘ perpauca ;’ he rarely finds the
spirit to speak, and when he does he
finds little to say.
attaches loquentis to animi (Lam-
binus and Bentley wished against the
MSS. to read ‘loquentem') may be
compared as a more prosaic form of the
same trope with Od. 4. 9. 34—44‚ note
on v. 39. For the qualitative gen. after
finxerunt me, an extension of its use
with ‘sum,’ cp. Sat. 2. 8. 84 ‘redis
mutatae frontis.’
