case, either Horace has used his legal
phrases carelessly‚ or we must suppose
the ‘ adversarius’ to be a disserent per-
son from the plaintiff of v. 36. This is
in itself unlikely. The formulae of this
passage are well illustrated from Plaut.
Persa 4. 9. 8, where Saturio is about to
prosecute Dordalus sor the abduction of
his daughter: ‘ Sa. Age, ambula in ius,
leno. Do. quid me in ius vocas? Sa. illi

SATIRE X.

LUCILIUS AND HORACE.

FAIR AND UNFAIR CRITICISM.

HORACE has been assailed by the school, of whom Demetrius and Hermogenes
Tigellius are the representatives, with contemptuous criticism on his Satire, and
especially for his words in Sat. 1. 4 about Lucilius. He replies by repeating and

justifying what he said.

also praised him for the wit and freedom of his satire. The two things are

consistent; you may praise a good mime; that does not imply that it is
perfect poetry. To make people laugh is a merit, but more is wanted—

brevity‚ play, and a proper alternation of declamatiou and irony. These are .

the characteristics of the great Greek comedians whom Hermogenes and his

school have never read.'

20—30. Horace's assailants are supposed to reply that Lucilius was elever at

mingling Greek phrases with Latin.

‘That is an easy trick,' he answers;

‘ but why do you admire it in poetry more than you would in oratory’?
