LIB. I. EPIST. 6. 245
Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.
Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum rex:
Ne fueris 1110 tu. Chlamydes Lucullus, ut aiunt, 40

Si posset centum scenae praebere rogatus,

‘Qui possum tot?’ ait; ‘tamen et quaeram et quot habebo
Mittam :² post paulo scribit sibi milia quinque

Esse domi chlamydum; partem vel tolleret omnes.

Exilis domus est ubi non et multa supersunt 45

Et dominum fallunt et prosunt furibus.

Ergo,

Si res sola potest facere et servare beatum,

Hoc primus repetas opuS‚ hoc postremus omittas.

Si fortunatum species et gratia praestat,

Mercemur servum qui dictet nomina, laevum 50
Qui fodicet latus et cogat trans pondera dextram

38. bene nummatum. A phrase
found in Cicero, de leg. Agr. 2. 22. 54
‘ adolescens non minus bene nummatus
quam bene capillatus.’

Suadela, Πειθώ. The man 01 money
is the rnan who is listened to, the man
who is loved.

39. The king of the Cappadocians
and Lucullus are instances, the former
01 faihu-e, the latter 01 success, in com-
plying with the precept to do what you
do thoroughly. Cicero. speaking of
Ariobarzanes, king os Cappadocia (pre-
decessor of Archelaus, who was king at
this timel, writes ‘nullum aerarium nul-
lum vectigal habet . . . nihil illo regno
spoliatius, nihil rege egentius’ ad Att.
6. 1, ‘ erat rex perpauper ' id. 6. 3.
The Roman slavemarket was flooded
with Cappadociam slaves. ‘The king
sends us many slaves but cannot pay
his tribute ; Lucullus was truly royal in
his magnificence.⁷ The story of Lucullus
is repeated by Plutarch in his 1116 01
111111.

40. ne fueris hie, ‘ do not answer to
this picture.' Cp. Epp. Ι. 15. 42 ‘hic
ego surn.’ For the long syllable ‘fueris'
see on Sat. 2. 2. 74.

chlamydes, the Greek soldier’s cloak‚
here wanted 101 a pageant on the stage.
Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 190.

44. tolleret, the subj. is the praetor
or the person giving the show.

46. fallunt, ‘are forgotten by,' as
by Lucullus in this instance.

47. faeere et servare beatum. The
repetition from v. 1 is meant to show

the connection. The phrase is varied
in v. 49 ⁵ fortunatum p1·aestat.’ We are
passing in review various ideals.

49. speeies, ‘ display,’ ⁴ splendour.'
Epp. 2. 2. 203. The edd. quote Cic.
Pis. 11. 24 ‘magnum nomen est, magna
species . . . consulis.'

50. qui dictet: what was called a
‘ nomenclator.’

laevum, as the slave would wall< on
the left side; see on Sat. 2. 5. 17. A
little doubt hangs over the reading. The
mass of MSS. (including the Bland.)
having ‘ saevum,⁷ which makes no sense.
Keller's E gives ‘ laevum) Ritter reads
‘ servum ³ with some slight MS. au-
thority, but the repetition has no intel-

ligible force.
51. trans pondera. A phrase which

has not been certainlyexplained. (1)The
Comm. Cruq. and Acron explain ‘pon-
dera ' as the high stepping-stones (such
as are to be seen in Pompeii) by which
people erossed from the raised path on
one side of the street to that 011 the
other; ‘to stretch half across the street.’
There is no other ground for thinking
that ‘pondera' was a technical name
for these stepping-stones‚ and it may be
a guess as baseless as others. It has
been taken in several other ways, as (2)
‘across the eounter‚’ 01 shaking hands
with tradesmen in a ‘taberna' opening
on the street, ‘pondera’ being the
weights used in scales. This view is
taken by Orelli, Keller, and Schiitz.
(3) ‘ Beyond your balanee,’ ‘ at risk of
tumbling down ⁹ Con. This was suggested
