LIB. I.

EPIST. 10.

263

Sic qui pauperiem veritus potiore metallis

Libertate caret, dominum vehit improbus atque 40
Serviet aeternum, quia parvo nesciet uti.

Cui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,

Si pede maior erit subvertet, si minor uret.

Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi,

Nec me dimittes incastigatum ubi plura 45
Cogere quam satis est ac non cessare videbor.

Imperat aut servit collecta pecunia cuique,

Tortum digna sequi potius quam ducere funem.

Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae,

Excepto quod non simul esses cetera laetus, 50

39. metallis: prob. like ‘lamna '
in Od. 2. 2. 4, the word is meant to
emphasize the purely material concep-
tion of wealth.

40. improbus: see the note on ‘ vio-
lens' in v. 37: ἀναιδής, for his un-
conscionable greed.

41. nesciet: the time corresponds to
serviet. The two pictures are two sides
of the same thing. He will always be a
slave because he will never be contented.

42, 43. Circumstances are like shoes
—they must be fitted to the person, not
the person to them—otherwise they are
sure to give trouble.

42. olim: Sat. 1. 1. 25, Epod. 3. 1
‘adverbium usitatum in fabellis et ex-
emplis’ Orell. It may refer to some
actual fable ofan ill-fitting shoe.

43. uret, ‘ gall.'

44. ‘You‚ Aristius, I know, will be
content, and so will live like a philo-
so her.'

1346. eessare, ‘ to take holidays'3 Epp.
1. 7. 57, 2. 2. 183. For ‘ac non' see
on Sat. 2. 3. 135.

48. The purport of the metaphor is
clear; but the source of it is uncertain.
It has been taken of an animal dragged
by a rope, of a barge, of a school-boys'
‘tug of war.' In all of these ‘tortum'
is (as in Virg. Aen. 4. 575 ‘Festinare
fugam, tortosque incidere funes ’) an
epithet without special force. Its em-
phatic position is perhaps against this
and in favour of the view (supported by
Schiitz) that the reference is to awindlass
or pulley (cp. Od. 3. 10. 10, which seems
to refer to a similar machine) ; ‘tortum ’
will then refer to the turning of the rope
in the process of hauling, and go with
‘ sequi,' not with ‘ ducere‚' ‘ to be at the

command of the machine and follow
the rope when it turns on the pulley,
not command it and draw the rope from
it as it will!

49. dictabam: the Epistolary im-
perfect, Madv. § 34¹·

post fanum putre Vacunae. From
all the evidence we judge (1) that Va-
cuna was the name of a Sabine goddess;
(2) that the Romans were very doubtful
with which of their deities to identify
her; (3) that one identification was with
Victoria, and that this was adopted by

rVespasian, the emperor of Sabine origin,

who, as an inscription shows, rebuilt
a ruined temple to Victoria at the vil-
lage now called Rocca Giovane, close
to Horace’s farm; (4) that the name
was often connected by the Romans
with ‘ vacare‚' ‘ vacuus‚’ and played upon
as meaning the goddess of ⁴ holiday' or
‘ laziness.' Fea quotes Auson. Epist. 4.
99 ‘Totam trado tibi simul Vacunam‚’
and an inser. ‘ Qui legis haec divae bona
verba precare Vacunae Nunc saltem
vacuo donet ut esse mihi.’ The words
have been used as a chief argument for
placing the site of Horace's villa
where there is some old terracing im-
mediately above the village of Rocca
Giovane, instead of in the place pre-
viously pointed out somewhat further
up the valley. It is doubtful, however,
whether they prove anything. See ad-
ditional note to Epp. 1. 16. ‘ Post ' may
be used loosely and mean only that in
going to the villa you passed the temple,
and the main object probably is not
to give a topographical definition but
(as in the quotations just given) a play
on the name of Vacuna, ‘in holiday-
land.'
