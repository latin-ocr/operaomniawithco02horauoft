HORATII SATIRARUM

Quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit
Versiculos natura magis factos et euntes
Mollius, ac si quis pedibus quid claudere senis,

Hoc tantum contentus, amet scripsisse ducentos

Ante cibum verSUS‚ totidem cenatus; Etrusci
Quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni
Ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque

Ambustum propriis ?

Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,

Comis et urbanus, fuerit limatior idem 65
Quam rudis et Graecis intacti carminis auctor,

Quamque poetarum seniorum turba: sed ille,

57. rerum dura natura. ‘ Rerum
de quibus scripsit' Acr.; but possibly
‘rerum natura' has its Lucretian or
Ciceronian sense of the total order of
things — ‘ some difficulty insuperable
whatever had been his individual force
and care.’ ¹ Dura' qualifies ‘ natura ’ as
constructed with ‘rerum,’ not with ‘illius'

58. magis factos, ‘more finished.'
Cic. de Orat. 3. 48. 184 ⁶ oratio polita
ac facta quodammodo.'

59. mollius, ac, ‘more smoothly
than.’ Though putting it in this in-
direct way, Horace repeats the charge of
Sat. 1. 4. 9 foll„ that Lucilius' rough-
ness was due to his rapid composition.

infinitive. Cp. Sat. Ι. Ι. 78. ‘Contentus'

61. Etrusci Cassi: a writer other-
wise unknown. The Seholiasts identified
him with the ‘Cassius Parmensis' of
Epp. 1. 4. 3,and all the earlier editors,
including even Bentley, followed them.
W'eichert, who treated the question
elaborately (De L. Varii et Cassii
Parmensis vita et carminibus—Grimae
1836), proved that this must be an error.
Even if the two epithets ‘Etrusci ' and
‘ Parmensis⁷ are not inconsistent as they
seem to be, the writer called ‘Cassius
Parmensis! according to all testimony,
was one os the conspirators against
Caesar, and was put to death in Athens
by the order of Octavianus aster the
battle of Actium, some years after the

urbanus, joined with ‘ comis ' in
Sat. 1. 4. 90. It seems to imply some
refinement in the humour, as that implies
good temper in it.

66. ‘ Than the creator of a new style
of poetry, and one unattempted by the
Greeks.' Does this mean (Ι) than he
was, or under the circumstances of his
writing could be? or (2) than some one
else, such as the writers of the early
Saturnian rhythm'? Casaubon taking (2)
altered ‘rudis et' to ‘Rudius‘ so that
the line definitely described Ennius. In
spite os some harshness of expression the
first is the most probable. Both ‘ Graecis
intacti carminis ’ and ‘ auctor ' are phrases
evidently meant to imply the praise of
originality which Horace always gives to
Lucilius ε see v. 48 and cp. Sat. 2. 1. 63.
Cp. Quintil. 10. 1. 93 ‘Satira quidem tota
nostra est (Horaee’s ‘ Graecis intactum
carmen ') in qua primus insignem laudem
adeptus Lucilius quosdam ita deditos
sibi adhuc habet amatores ut eum non
eiusdem modo operis auctoribus sed
