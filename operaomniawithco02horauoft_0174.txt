HORATII SATIRARUM

‘ Quin id erat curae quo pacto cuncta tenerem,

Utpote res tenues tenui sermone peractas.’

Ede hominis nomen, simul et Romanus 311 hospes. 10
‘Ipsa memor praecepta canam, celabitur auctor.

Longa quibus facies ovis erit illa memento,

Ut suci melioris et ut magis alba rotundis,

Ponere3 namque marem cohibent callosa vitellum.

Caule suburbano qui siccis crevit in agris 15
Dulcior3 irriguo nihil est elutius horto.

Si vespertinus subito te oppresserit hospes,

Ne gallina malum responset dura palato,

Doctus eris vivam mixto mersare Falern03

Hoc teneram faciet.

8. Catius is mollified by the com-
pliment‚ and enters into the thought.
‘Ay‚ that is what I was thinking of,
how to keep in my mind every single
word, sor indeed they were nice points,
and handled throughout in nice style.’

9. utpote: Sat. 1. 4. 24, 1. 5. 94,
A. P. 206.

tenues, λεπτάς, opp. to what is
coarse and common; see on Od. 2. 16.

10. ede: Sat. 2. 5. 61. The word is
used of 0136165, of persons who §peak
with authority, etc.

simul et, a common eombination in

prose; ‘ at the same time also.' ‘ Ro-
manus [ne sit] 311 11051165]
11. canam, answers ‘ ede’3 of ora-

cular utterance, Sat. 1. 9. 30.

celabitur auctor : 3 Ρ311 of the
play, but beyond our guessing.

12. ovis: see on Sat. 1. 3. 7 ‘ab ovo
usque ad mala) The eggs come first in
the lecture, 35 first served in the feast.

13. suci, ‘ flavour,' as explained by
Plin. N. H. 10. 74. 52 ‘quae oblonga
sint ova gratioris saporis putat Ho-
ratius Flaccus.⁷

alba: the epithet probably refers to
the white as it looks when cooked—it is
whiter. It is otherwise taken of the yolk
and white together—‘ pale-coloured.’
But why should that be a merit 2 Heind.
reads ‘alma‚’ a conj. of Bentley's.

14. ponere, ‘to serve'; see on Sat.
2. 2. 2 3.

namque ε 11 15 implied that the yolk
of an egg which would hatch a cock-
bird is fuller flavoured. Columella (8.
5. 11) and Pliny (l. c.) agree with

Pratensibus optima fungis 20

Horace that the longer eggs produce
the coeks‚ the rounder ones hens 3
Aristotle (Hist. Anim. 6. 2. 2) states
the fact the other way.

callosa: either the white is firmer,
or, possibly, the skin which encloses the
yolk is stronger.

15. suburbano: the market gardens
near Rome would be more caresully
iffigated, probably more richly manured.
Pliny⁷s statement (N. H. 1. 9. 41) coin-
eides, ‘ humor fimusque si defuere maior
saporis gratia 651, 51 abundavere laetior
fertilitas.'

16. elutius, ‘more watery‚’ ’1351616553

horto, i. e. the contents of a garden.

17. vespertinus hospes. Cp. Epod.
16. 51 ‘ vespertinus . . . ursus,' Sat. 2.6.
100 ⁴ nocturni.’

oppresserit, ‘ have surprised you.’

18. malum, adverbially. Cp. ‘ ca-
net indoetum' Epp. 2. 2. 9; ‘malum
responset ³ ‘ makes unkind answer,’ ‘dis-
appoints.' It is not quite the same use
as ‘responsare’ without 311 adv. in Sat.
2. 7. 85 and 103, Epp. 1. 1. 68.

palato, ⁴ the taste,’ as below, v. 46.

19. doetus eris. The tense corre-
sponds to ‘ si oppresserit‚' ‘ you will
know what to do.'

mixto Falerno. Grammatically
rather an absol. than a local abl„ to
mix F alemian and drown the fowl ; the
commoner element is taken sor granted.
Bentley read ex mera coni. ‘ musto,’ and
is followed by Heindorf and Palmer;
‘ mersare' probably, as he took it, =
‘ mersando occidere.’

20. pratensibus: as contrasted with
those of the woods.
