THE LITERARY EPISTLES. 335

to literature3 the indication of the constitutional Roman vice of
avarice as tainting literary men and spoiling their work ,- the
complaint of audiences as inevitably lowering the standard of those
who wrote for them; the vindication (in one case, as suits the place,
playsul, in the other more unmixedly serious) of the dignity and
use os poetry3 the disproportionate share given (however it be
explained) to the drama3 the special attack on Plautus 3 the use of
Choerilus as the type of a poetaster. The more closely the passages
in which these occur are compared, the more likely, Ι believe, it will
be thought that the treatment of the topics in the Ars Poetica is the
later, as it is the fuller. But if this judgment is distrusted we may
still ask which is the most probable‚ that Horace should have
gathered freely from earlier compositions materials for a letter
intended primarily to guide a young literary friend, or that when
he is bending his energies to write a particularly happy and accept-
able Epistle to the Emperor he should take so many of its points
from one which he had written ten years before to some compara-
tively nameless young friends.

I do not know whether it is fanciful to see some confirmation of
the later date in the new attitude which seems to be assumed in the
poem towards the moral principles and language of which we heard
so much in earlier writings. Sapere aude is the textos Epp. 1. 2.
Sapere est abiectis utile nugis (i.e. ‘ flinging away poetry as nothing
but an idle amusement⁷) is the conclusion of Epp. 2. 2. Scribendi
recte sapere est et prz‘ffzcspz'zcrlz et sons is the motto of the Ars
Poetica. In accordance with this change of view the principles
which have been maintained in the moral sphere are now shown to
have their bearing in literary matters : the virtue of consistency‚ the
falsehood of extremeS, the necessity of effort and thoroughness, the
danger of falling into one fault from dread of another, the duty of
give and take, of weighing merits against faults before you condemn,
the valuelessness of a bribed judgment, the folly of the false shame
which prefers to acquiesce in mischiefs rather than confess and cure
them. Mora] phrases have got a new literary application ι ‘ rectum,'
‘virtus,⁷ ‘vitiu1n,' ‘error‚' ‘quod decet‚' ‘vir bonus et prudens.' It
is as though Horace's two tastes and interests had run at last into
one stream. Philosophy is no longer the rival of poetry, but has
become her instructress. The study of the ‘ Socraticae chartae ' has
ended in the Rhetoric and Poetic.
