 

LIB. I.

Sanos dicatur.

SAT. 3. 43

Quanto hoc furiosius atque

Maius peccatum est! paulum deliquit amicus,

Quod nisi concedas habeare insuavis: acerbus 85
Odisti et fugis ut Rusonem debitor aeris,

Qui nisi, cum tristes misero venere Kalendae,

Mercedem aut nummos unde unde extricat, amaras
Porrecto iugulo historias captivus ut audit.

Comminxit lectum potus mensave catillum 90
Evandri manibus tritum deiecit, ob hanc rem

to an orator described by the elderSeneca
(Praef. ad lib. 5 Controv.) who, from ac-
eesses of furious temper, was nicknamed
‘ Rabienus‚’ and who slew himself from
vexation on the destruction of his books
by his enemies. The Scholiast's note,
however, seems a sufficient evidence that
‘Labeone ' is the correct reading. We
are left therefore without the means of
explaining the reference.

inter sanos =⁴ apud sanos‚' ‘ a sanis,’
as Livy 6. 34 ‘haudquaquam inter id
genus contemptor habebatur.' Some
edd. have taken ‘ inter sanos dicatur ’ as
=‘inter sanos numeretur': sometimes
putting the mark of a question, ‘though
madder than Labeo, would he be
reckoned among sane persons?y (Do-
ering) ε sometimes categorically‚ ‘he
would be madder than Labeo, although
reckoned among sane persons.' (Hein-
dorf.)

83. hoc, the nom. case3 ‘ this which
follows.'

85. concedas, ‘ excuse?
Satire (1. 4. 140) it is used in this sense
with a dative. A doubt has been raised
as to the punctuation. The Pseudo—
Acron took ‘insuavis ‚ acerbus’ together,
the asyndeton as in v. 58. Of recent
editors Orelli and Ritter follow him.
Bentley, followed by Diilr„ Holder, and
Munro, joins ‘ acerbus odisti.’ In either
case ‘acerbus’ is a stage beyond ‘ in-
suavis.'

86. Rusonem. The Sehol. add no-

In the next

thing except that they call him Octavius
Ruso. Mayor on Juv. Sat. 3. 9, in his
exhaustive note on Recitation, compares
a similar story told by Philostratus, the
author of the ‘Lives of Sophists‚’ of one
Varo, whose debtors were allowed to
count attendance at his declamations
as a set-off against interest due to him.
Polemon, whose biography he is giving,

found the task too severe, ‘ sprang up,
held out his hands and eried φέρε τοὺς
τύπους, “ bring the writ.’'’ Macaulay’s
story of the criminal who chose the
galleys in preference to listening to
Guicciardini's history, is a descendant
of these older jests.

87. tristes Kalendae. See on Epod.
2. 69.

88. mercedem aut nummos, ‘ inter-
est or principal.' The price paid for
the use of the money, or the money itself.
For ‘ merces' in this sense see Sat. 1. 2.
14.

unde unde = ‘ undecunque.'
67. 27. So ‘ ubi ubil ‘ quis quis.³

amaras. So ‘recitator acerbus' A.

894 porrecto iugulo, as a eon-
quered gladiator offering his throat
to be cut (Cic. Mil. 11. 31 ‘ dare
iugulum ²). For the metaph. ep. (of
Horace at the mercy of the bore)
‘me sub cultro linquit ' Sat. 1. 9.
74, and the ‘ recitator acerbus’ os
A. P. 474, ‘ tenet occiditque
legendo.’

90. catillum. Sat. 2. 4 75, where
note the uses of such a vessel.

91. Evandri manibus tritum, i. e.
of some absurdly exaggerated antiquity.
Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 20, where Damasippus is
said to have hunted up the brazen foot-
pan used by Sisyphus; also Martial's
epigram upon the rage for old curiosities
(8. 6) ⁴ Archetypis vetuli nihil est odio-
sius Eucti . . . Hoc cratere ferox commisit
praelia Rhaecus Cum Lapithis; pugna
debile cernis opus. Hi duo longaevo
censentur Nestore fundi, Pollice de Pylio
trita columba nitet.’ The Scholiasts
explain it os the work of Auianius Evan-
der, an artist contemporary with Horace ;
and it is to be notieed that this is one os
the places where Porphyrion refers defi-

Catuli.
