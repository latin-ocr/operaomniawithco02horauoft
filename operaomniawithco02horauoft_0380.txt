HORATII EPISTULARUM

Litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti

Cuilibet3 argilla quidvis imitaberis uda3

Quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti:

Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo 10
Laudat venales qui volt extrudere merces.

Res urget me nulla3 meo sum pauper in aere.

Nemo hoc mangonum faceret tibi3 non temere a me
Quivis ferret idem. Semel hic cessavit et, ut fit,

In scalis latuit metuens pendentis habenae. 15
Des nummos, excepta nihil te si fuga laedit':

7. litterulis Graecis imbutus A
useful accomplishment‚ as it fitted him
to be a reader g‘lector’) or copying
clerk (‘librarius’). Both the diminu-
tive and the part. ‘imbutus' (‘ with a
tincture') disparage its amount. It is
not the cue of the seller to seem to make
much of the slave's merits.

8. imitaberis, ‘ the clay is still moist,
you will be able to mould it as you
like.' A few MSS. have ‘imitabitur‚'
a v, l. which is noticed and condemned
by Aer. It would mean that the slave
can, or can be taught, to model in clay,
—au ingeni0115, but evidently needless
and wrong emendation of some one who
did not understand the metaphor. Some
MSS. have ‘i1nitabimur,⁷ which Keller
considers an emendation of ·’ imitabitur'
by a copyist who was feeling his way
back to the true reading. Persius had
in mind Horace's metaphorical use of
the image in ‘ udum et molle lutum es,’
etc. 3. 23.

9. canet indoctum sed dulce: for
adverbial acc. cp. Epp. 1. 7. 27 ‘dulce
loqui, ridere deeorum.'

dulce bibenti: ‘quo tempore faci-
liores sumus ad veniam etiam servulis
(landam ’ Orell.

10. levant: as Comm. Cruq. ‘levi-
orem faciunt, minuunt.' He suggests
that he might promise much more if
he had not this tear before his eyes.

1 1. extrudere seems to mean ‘ to get
rid os,' with the idea that some force is
required for the purpose. The unusual
meaning helped perhaps to the v. 1. in
all the Bland„ and in some others os
Keller's (Class ΙΙΙ.) MSS. ‘excludere,⁷
which however is less intelligible. K.
shows that ‘excludere' is found in mis-
take for ‘extrudere’ in some MSS. of
Ter. Hec. 1. 2. 58 and in other places,

12. meo in aere z i. e. not in debt—
as Cicero opposes ‘in suis nummis' to
‘in aere alieno' Verr. 4. 6. 11. For
pauper see on Od. 1. 1. 18.

13. mangonum, ‘ the slave-dealers ’ 3
Juv. S. 11. 147 ε 566 Mayor's note.

14. cessavit, ‘was lazy.' Cp. Sat.
2. 7. 100 ‘ nequam et cessator Davus?

ut fit, ‘as boys will do.' An inno-
cent colour is put on it.

15. in scalis. This is taken either
with latuit, or with pendentis. In
the first case the stairs are named as a
hidingplace, as in Cic. Mil. 15. 40 and
Phil. 2. 9. 21 Clodius is said to have
taken refuge ‘in scalarum tenebras' ‘in
scalas tabernae'; ‘pendentis' will then
mean ‘ on the peg‚' i. e. hung up for use
and sor the warning os the slaves. But
possibly the second is best. The boy is
supposed really to have run away. To
say ‘ latuit ' is sair, ‘' he couldn't be found.'
‘ln scalis latuit ' is too definite a ‘ sug-
gestio falsi.’

16. I follow Bentley,
Munro in taking this line as the eon-
clusion of the seller's speech, ‘ Put down
the money, unless, which I can't think,
the exception Ι have made os his having
“run away’' troubles you.⁷ laedit is
the reading of V, accepted by the same
editors, and is perhaps preferable in
sense to ‘ laedat.' The subj.‚ by making
it a regular conditional sentence, gives
more prominence and possibility to the
difficulty. The ind. makes it paren-
thetical‚ an afterthought‚ and assumes
that the drawback named does not
‘trouble ’ the customer. Orelli, on the
other hand, makes ‘ des [tu] . . . ille
ferat ‘ two parallel clauses of the apo-
dosis to ⁴ si quis‚' etc.. vv. 2, 3. It seems
essential that the damaging word ‘ fuga'
should be actually used by the seller,

Ritter‚ and
