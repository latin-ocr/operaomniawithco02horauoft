to be found in such phrases as Cic. the partitive gen. cp. Od. 3. 13. 13 ‘fies
Rep. 1. 43 ‘ senes ad ludum ado· nobilium tu quoque fontium.’
lescentium descendant,' not in such as fortem bonumque. It is a common
‘descendat in campum' Od. 3. 1. 11. conjunction in Cicero, as Mil. 2. 43 cp.
13. tui gregis. As Cicero uses ‘grex ‘iustum et fortem ' Sat. 2. 1. 16. The
aniicorum' ad Att. 1. 18. 1, ¹ gregales' words imply high pmise, for they are

EPISTLE X.

TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS.

Verses 1—7. HAIL to Fuscus, brother of my soul! parted from me by no single
difference, but that he loves the town while Ι love the country.

8—11. I will tell you why this is—I have lost my taste for town delights3 Ι care
now for the bread. not for the honey-cakes.

12-21. If nature is to be our standard of life, and that means first, of choosing
a site for living, what town site can beat the country—sheltered winters,
cool summer5‚ fragrant groves and flowers, fresh water!

22-25. When you build a town house you try to reproduce these things ; you plant
trees in the peristyle, and choose a site with a country view. Nature re-asserts
herself in spite of your efforts to get rid of her.

26—34. There are spurious imitations in lise as well as in upholstery, and a mistake
about them is more mischievous. Such is setting our admiration on wealth.
We prepare for ourselves disappointments. A humble life may be happier
than a grand one.

35-41. The man who inereases his desires is like the horse who called in the man
to help him against the stag—he has surrendered his freedom.

42, 43. circumstances are like shoes-—if they don't fit, they hurt us.

44—48. You, Aristius, will find true philosophy in eontentment, and will expect
your friend to do the same. Wealth should be our servant, not our master.

49, 50. I am writing on my Sabine estate behind the temple of Vacuna.

Aristius Fuscus, like Septimius in the last Epistle, is one of Horace’s older
friends. See Sat. 1. 9. 61, 1. 10. 833 Od. 1. 22 ‘Integer vitae’ is addressed to

him. See the introd. to that Ode for the continuity of tone between it and this
Epistle.

URBIS amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus
Ruris amatoreS, hac in re scilicet una

1. salvere iubemus: Epp. 1. 7. 66. what Drager (Hist. Syntax ῐ. ξ 9) calls
It is a formula of greeting in letters as the ‘ pluralis modestiae.' Cp. Od. 1.
well as by word of mouth. Cic. ad Att. 32. 1.

4. 14. 2. The plural, which in such 2-6. ‘Lovers of the country; sor in
cases often alternates with the sing„ is this one point you must know vie differ
