TO THE SATIRES. 1 r

κ)

chosen as prologue¹ and epilogue. ( 3) For the rest wc may trace from
time to time either links of thought which attract Satires together or
the desire of variety which seems to keep them apart. Of the first,
instances are Sat. 1. 2 working out the thought which had come to the
front in 1. 1. 101 f.; 1. 4 giving its full significance to 1. 33 perhaps 2. 4
matching a sally against the Epicureans with 2. 3 which had laughed
at the Stoies. Of the second, the separation of 2. 3 from 2. 7, of
2. 2 from 2. 4, and of that again from 2. 8. There is perhaps a sug-
gestion of the irony so often seen in the placing of the Odes in the
collocation of Sat. 2. 7, with its coarse slave—humour and its turning
of his satiric sting upon himself, after 2. 6, in which his tone has
been higher and more didactic than usual: compare the position of

Epp. 1. 15, 16, 17.
