LIB. II.

SAT. 4. 165

Piscibus atque avibus quae natura et foret aetas, 45
Ante meum nulli patuit quaesita palatum.

Sunt quorum ingenium nova tantum crustula promit.
Nequaquam satis in re una consumere curam3

Ut si quis solum hoc, mala ne sint vina, laboret,

Quali perfundat pisces securus olivo. 50
Massica si caelo suppones vina sereno

Nocturna si quid crassi est tenuabitur aura,

Et decedet odor nervis inimicus; at illa

Integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem.

Surrentina vafer qui miscet faece Falerna 55
Vina columbino limum bene colligit ovo,

Quatenus ima petit volvens aliena vitellus.

probably to the belief in their super-
fetation (Pliny N. H. 8. 55). It means
therefore a female hare, and is meant
probably to limit and give (though
without explaining) the reason of the
wise man’s preference of the shoulders.
For a gastronomical refinement turning
on a similar point see Sat. 2. 8. 43: see
also 2. 8. 89. To make ‘fecundae'
otiose and throw the stress of the pre-
cept on the choice of the part of the
animal only, is to lose the key of the
passage which 1165 111 vv. 45, 46. It
professes to contain original observa-
tions ‘de natura‚’ about the physical
conditions, of shell—fish, boars, roedeer,
hares. The lecturer contents himself
with suggesting, without proving, that
he has in 51016 other observations of
the same kind ‘de natura aut aetate’
of fish and birds. Note also that there
is both in v. 43 and 44 an air of mys-
tery affected, of 1111111 only partially re—
vealed.

sapiens, ‘ the philosopher.' The word
is in the spirit of vv. 2, 3,; cp. ‘inge-
nium ’ v. 47.

45. quae natura: not absolutely‚but
in reference to their fitness for table3
but the language is as if he were a new
Aristotle, ‘ palatum,' coming almost
παρὰ προσδοκίαν, at the end.

47—50. ‘ The philosopher must take
a large view, not narrow himself to a
single corner of his subject? This is
an apology sor the apparently miscel-
laneous character ofthe precepts; vv. 49,
50 also give a rough summary of the

passage to follow, v. 49 referring to
vv. 51s62, v. 50 to vv. 63-69.

47. crustula, ‘ past1·y'; see on Sat. 1.
1. 25.

48. satis, sc. ‘estu’

consumere, ‘to use it a11,’ ‘use it
u .’

p50. securus, with the indirect ques—
tion. So Od. 1. 26. 6, Epp. 2. 1. 176.

51. Put your Massic wine in the open
air to tone it down. Do not strain it
or you will spoil the flavour. Surrentine
wine should be mixed with the lees of
Falernian, and then cleared with a
pigeon's egg.

53. odor nervis inimicus. Cp.
Virgil's description of a potent wine
‘temptatura pedes' G. 2. 04. The in-
toxicating effect is here attributed to
the smell.

illa, sc. ‘ Massica vina?

55. Surrentina, from Surrentum at
1116 5011111 end of the bay of NapleS.
Pliny names the wine as ‘ concalescen-
tibus probatum propter tenuitatem ’
N. H. 14. 8. 1. It is to be fortified
with the hardened sediment of the
stronger Falernian. This is a mode of
treatment described by Columella (12.
30) ‘sumito faecem vini boni et panes
facito et in sole arefacito . . . postea
terito et pondo quadrantem amphoris
singulis infricat0.'

vafer, ‘ as a connoisseur.'

57. quatenus‚‘inasmuclias.’ See on
Sat. 1. 1. 64.

aliena, ‘ all foreign matter;' the float-
ing particles called ‘limum ’ 111 v. 26.
