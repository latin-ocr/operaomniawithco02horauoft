latter case there is still the rule of
internal consistency.

120. scriptor, ‘ as a writer' ς ‘ when
you write.’ An instance of Horace’s
use of substantives for participles: so
inf. v. 134 ‘ imitator,‘ v. 235 ‘Satyr-
orum scriptor.’

honoratum. Bentley, offended at all
the explanations of this word, substi-
tuted ex coni. ‘ Homereum‚’ ‘the Achilles
of Homer,' and his conjecture has been
accepted by several eminent critics and
editors, as Haupt, Meineke, Munro.
The Pseudo-Acron writes ‘alii exponunt:
Reponis, iterum scribis. Siergo Achillem
de quo 5611161 Homerus scripsit velis
scribere talem debes facere qualem
Homerus ostendit.’ Bentley contends
that this points to their having read
‘Homereum.' But if the full note is
read it will be more evident than it
is in what has been quoted that he is
offering an explanation, different from
one given before, of ‘reponis' ‘agaim'
he says ‘that 15Δ 35 Homer did before.’
All the Scholiasts also have a further
note, ζ11011013111111, inlustrem, honoris
plenum.' lt must be clear, therefore,
that ‘honoratum' was the only text
known to them. Various efforts have
been made to explain the epithet as a
translation or allusion to some Homeric
phrase or view of the character: κλυτός,
which has been suggested, is not an
epithet ever given to Achilles. He is
once δουρικλυτός, a few times φαίδιμος,
often δῖος; but if it were meant as a
translation it must be of some epithet
which it would clearly recall, and which
belongs markedly to him. Cp. the
choice of epithets for Homeric charac-
ters in Od. 1. 6 and 15. Ritter thinks
that the reference 15 rather to the ⁴ hon-
ouring ‘ ofAchilles as the true subject of
the Iliad is, ‘Iovis consilio et auxilio

honoratum, ut post varias Achivorum
clades viro ab Agamemnone contempto
iusta fiat satisfactio.‘ Cp. Il. 1. 505 f.‚
2. 3, 13. 348, 24. 57, and notice that
Horace recalls (Od. 2. 16. 29) that
Achilles chose κλέος ἄφθιτον 411. 9. 412)
in preference to long life. It has been
suggested to me that there is something
playful in the ‘si forte, reponis, honora-
tum,' and that the epithet belongs not to
the person, but to the literary character;
‘if you are representing once more the
time honoured character of Achilles.’

123. Ino, the unhappy daughter of
Cadmus and wife of Athamas, who,
when her maddened husband had torn
one of her children 111 pieces, flying with
the other, Melicerta (νὺξ. G. 1. 437),
flung herself into the sea and became
a sea-goddess Glaucothea.

128—135. The connection of thought
which we require is, ‘the second alter-
native which 1 offered you, namely‚ to
invent your characters, is difficult. You
do better t0 dramaiize part of the tale of
Troy than to start a wholly new plot3
and do not sear that by taking stock sub-
jects you will be debarred from origin·

It is difficult not to think that Horace
has in mind the substance of Arist.
Poet. 9, where Aristotle explains and

vindicates the practice of the Greek tra-
gedians in 6110051111Γ iainiliarmythological
stories sor their plots. He starts with
the distinction between particular truths
(καθ’ ἕκαστον) ‘what Alcibiades did or
what happened to hirn‚' and general
truths (καθόλου), ‘what sort of things
3 person of such and such a sort will
probably or necessarily do,’ and assigns
the first as the sphere of history, the
