prosilit, ζ leaps ashore.’ The canal we
must suppose was very narrow, as the
bargeman seems to have driven the mule
from the boat3 he is now asleep on the
bank.

22. saligno: cut for the purpose
from the willows on the bank.

23. dolat. A comio word, as it
seems properly to have been used of
‘ hewing,' ‘ trimming ¹ with an axe.

quarta. As an ‘honr' in the Roman
sense was a twelsth part of the time
between sunrise and sunset, the meaning
of the ‘ fourth hour' will vary with the
time of year. If the journey was made,
as seems likely, near the equinox, it will
correspond nearly with the hour between
nine and ten of our time. There is the
further doubt whether ‘ at the fourth
hour’ means at the beginning of it or at
the end of it.

24. tua, Feronia, lympha. A shrine
with a grove and fountain at the foot of
the hills skirting the Pomptine marsh
some three miles from Tarracina. Virgil
mentions it in connection with Circeii
and Anxur, Aen. 7. 800 ‘ viridi gaudens
Feronia luco.’ Feronia was an Italian

> goddess, who had also a shrine at the

root of Mount Soracte, Liv. 1. 30.

name of Tarracina. It is the point at

30

which the Volscian hills, and also
the Via Appia strike the sea. For its
lofty situation see Liv. 5. 12 ‘alto loco
situ1n‚’ (although elsewhere (4. 59)
he describes it as ‘ urbs prona in
paludes,’ ‘ sloping down to the marsh ³),
cp. ‘praecipites . . . Anxuris arces,⁷

speaks of the city as having descended
in his day to the lower level, although
there were still remains of building, even
of the city walls, on the top of the hill
where it stood in Horace's time.

27. huc venturus, probably by sea.

optimus. It has been doubted
whether the epithet belongs to Maecenas
or to Cocceius. Bentley is doubtless
right in taking it with the latter. The
same question has been raised at Sat.
1. 10. 82 ‘ Valgius et probet haee Octa-
vius optimus atque Fuscus,' where the
rhythm more imperatively than here
requires the pause before ⁴ optimus ' for
‘ atque Fuscus ' would be intolerable. It
is also probably true that for Maecenas
⁴ optimus' would be as Bentley says ‘com-
pellatio paullo familiarior :' it is a higher
compliment to leave his name without
an epithet. ‘ The worthiest of men' is
then almost an apology for bringing the
name ofCocceius into such near relation
with that of Maecenas.

29. soliti. As the previous peace of
Brundisium had been due to their offices.
For Cocceius and for the reference of this
verse see above in Introd. to the Satire.

30. hic . . . ego. This is Horace's
personal reminiscence of Tarracina, in
