68 HORATII SATIRARUM

Tendimus hinc recta Beneventum; ubi sedulus hospes

Paene macros arsit dum turdos versat in igni:

Nam vaga per veterem dilapso flamma culinam

Volcano summum properabat lambere tectum.

Convivas avidos cenam servosque timentes 75
Tum rapere, atque omnes restinguere velle videres.

Incipit ex illo montes Apulia notos

Ostentare mihiy quos torret Atabulus et quos

Nunquam erepsemu5‚ nisi nos vicina Trivici

Villa recepisset, lacrimoso non sine fumo, 80
Udos cum foliis ramos urente camino.

Hic ego mendacem stultissimus usque puellam

Ad mediam noctem exspecto: somnus tamen aufert

require ‘hanc' rather than ‘ illam' seems
to be answered by v. 77.

71. recta, ‘without halts.' This
seems to be mentioned because the
stage is a short one, twelve miles. Bene-
ventum owed to its position on the
Ap1›ian road much of its historieal im-
portance, and especially the triumpha]
arch in memory of Trajan's Dacian
triumph which still adorns it.

hospes, as ‘hospitium' in v. 2 of
an innkeeper. The picture is comic;
the bustling host, the roaring fire, the
skinny fieldfares.

72- macros. Contrast Epp. 1. 15.
41 ‘obeso Nil melius turdo;⁷ cp. Sat.
2. 5. 10. The host has got what is
reekoned a dainty, but they are in poor
condition.

arsit, set himself (ie. his house) on
fire. As Virg. Aen. 2. 311 ‘iam proximus
ardet Ucalegon,' JUV. 3. 201 ‘Ultimus
ardebit.’ The confused order of the
words ‘Paene macros arsit dum turdos
versat’ may be compared with Sat. 1.
3. 70, 2. 1. 60, 2. 3. 211; and see
note on Od. Ι. 6. 2. Orelli and Dillr.
suggest (perhaps fancifully) that it is in
imitation of the scene of confusion de-
scribed. For the tense os ‘versat' cp.
inf. v. 100 and Sat. 2. 4. 79; Epp. 1. 2.
21, 2. 1. 7, 2. 2. 27; A. P. 465: and
see Madv. 336, obs. 2.

73. Note the mock heroic rhythm
and phraseology‚ ‘dilapso Volcano,' etc.
·The firegod slipped abroad amid the
old rasters of the kitchen, and the {lame
on its travels was well nigh wrapping
the rooftree.’

75. avidos, timentes. The guests
thought of their spoiiing dinner—the
slaves of the blame to be laid at their
doors. The other touches are graphio.
The first thought is to save the supper,
the second to put out the fire. Note
also the art which puts ‘avidos' next
to ¹ cenam.'

76. videres, the past tense of‘videas '
= ⁴ videre licebat ; ‘ see on Sat. 1. 3. 5.

77. notos, the mountains which stood
at the head of the waters of his own
Aufidus.

78. Atabulus. It is named in Pliny
(N. H. 17. 37. Si as a hot dry wind
peculiar to Apulia and destructive to
vegetation. Cp. the Vulturnus, a wind
which blew on the plains of Apulia,
‘torridis siccitate campis’ Liv. 22. 46.
and carried clouds of dust in the eyes
of the Romans at Cannae.

79. erepsemus, of the slow process
of climbing to the top of the pass. For
the form cp. Sat. 1. 9. 73 ‘ surrexe,' 2. 3.
169 ‘divisse,’ 2. 3. 273 ‘percusti‚' 2. 7.
68 ⁴ evasti.‘

vicina, constructed as a subst. with
gen.

Trivici. ‘Trivicum' is not men-
tioned elsewhere. The modern town
of Trevico is on the top of a hill; the
farmhouse (‘ villa’) where the travellers
found refuge before their final ascent,
lay. no doubt, below it in the valley.

So. lacrimoso fumo. A grievanee
which would try Horace especially, v.
49. They were among the hills now
and might need fires for warmth as well
as cooking.
