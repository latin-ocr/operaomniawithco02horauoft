SATIRE V.

TIRESIAS, OR LEGACY-HUNTING.

THIS practice is touched in passing in Epp. 1. 1. 77. It is described in Cicero,
Paradox 5. 2 ‘An eorum servitus dubia est, qui eupiditate peculii nnllam con-
ditionem recusant durissimae servitutis? Hereditatis spes quid iniquitatis in ser-
viendo non suscipit? quem nutum locupletis orbi senis nou observat? Loquitur
ad voluntatem: quidquid denunciatum sit, facit: assectatur, assidet, muneratur.¹
The ‘orbitas' which was the temptation to it belongs to that disinclination to
marriage and its responsibilities which was a marked feature of Roman life. See
notes on Od. 4. 7. 19, C. S. 18—20.

The satirical description of the arts of a ‘captator' (v. 57) is thrown into the
form of a burlesque continuation of the dialogue between Ulysses and the shade of
Tiresias in Odyss. 11.

It starts with Tiresias' prophecy in v. 1 14 foll.

ὀψὲ κακῶς νεΐαι ὀλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους,
νηὸς ἐπ’ ἀλλοτρίης· δήεις δ’ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ
ἄνδρας ὑπερφιάλους οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσι.

Verses 1-3. Ulysses.—‘ One more thing, Ti1·esias; you should tell me how to re-
trieve my lost fortunes. Why do you laugh 2 ³

3—5. Τίνωῑίις.-ι Is it not enough for a man of your renown that you shall get sase
home ἒ '

5—8. Clysses.—‘ The good part of your prophecy is no doubt true3 but so is the
bad. and I am to arrive at home stripped of all 1 have, and find my stores
plundered by the suitors. What is a man without substance, even if he be a
king 01· a hero 2 '

9, 10. Tz'a-esz'as.—‘ It is a simple case, and may be prescribed for simply. What
you dread is “ pauperies ''; listen, and hear how to become “ dives.'⁷

10—17. Make up to some rich old man. If a delicacy is given to you, send it on
to him—the best produce of your sarm ; he must come before the household
gods. VVhatever his character and antecedents, never resuse to wall< with him
and give him the place of honour.'

18-22. Ulysses. ‘ The place of honour to Dama! That is to belle all I ever was.'
Tiresias. ‘ Very well, then you must be content to go without wealth.'
Ulysses. ‘ I submit ; 1 have borne worse than this—only tell me, prophet, how
to amass wealth.’

23-26. Tiresias. ‘Ihave told you already. Turn legacy-hunter; don't be easily
discouraged if one or another escapes you.
