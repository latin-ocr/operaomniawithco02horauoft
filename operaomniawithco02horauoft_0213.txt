LIB. II.

SAT. 8.

201

Si memini Varius; cum Servilio Balatrone
Vibidius, quas Maecenas adduxerat umbras.
Nomentanus erat super ipsum, Porcius infra
Ridiculus totas simul absorbere placentas;
Nomentanus ad hoc, qui si quid forte lateret
Indice monstraret digito: nam cetera turba,
Nos, inquam, cenamus aveS, conchylia, pisces,
Longe dissimilem noto celantia succum;

Ut vel continuo patuit, cum passeris atque
Ingustata mihi porrexerat ilia rhombi. 30
Post hoc me docuit melimela rubere minorem

Ad lunam delecta.
Audieris melius.

3. 9. 14l, on the west side of the Taren-
tine gulf. From his juxtaposition
here, as in Sat. 1. 10, with Varius and
Fundanius, he is probably one of the
two Visci named in Sat. 1. 10. 83.

21. Varius: Od. 1. 6. 1 n.‚ Sat.
1. 5. 40, ete.

Balatrone: Sat. 1. 2. 2. It would
seem to be a nickname = ‘jester’ or
‘buflbons

Servilio, to be scanned as a tri-
syllable: see on Sat. 1. 7. 30 ‘vin-
demiator'; the first ‘i' is long: see
Juv. S. 10. 319.

22. umbras: Epp. Ι. 5. 28; un-
invited guests brought in the suite of
some guest of distinction.

23. Nomentanus and Porcius are the
parasites of the host.

ipsum, Nasidienus. As explained
in the introduction, Nomentanus occu-
pied the place usually belonging to
the host. The reason is given in v. 25,
for ‘ad hoc' goes back to ‘erat super
ipsum.' He was put there as knowing
more about cookery than Nasidienus,
to point out the features of the banquet
to Maecenas. The names are chosen
each with a malicious purpose, Nomen-
tanus recalling the ‘ spendthrift ' of Sat.
1. 1. 102 (see note there), 1. 8. ΙΙ,
2. 1. 22, 2. 3. 175, 2243 Porcius as
suiting his greediness.

24. ridiculus absorbere:
App. 2.

simul. The MSS. vary between ‘si-
mul’ and ‘ semel? Either makes sense3
‘totas simul‘ or ‘semel (‘ at one
mouthful ³) absorbere.’ There isa doubt

vol. 1 ,

Quid hoc intersit ab ipso
Tum Vibidius Balatroni:

also between absorbere and ‘obsor-
bere.’

26. indice digito, the forefinger.

cetera turba, the rest of us, besides
Maecenas.

28. celantia adds to the force of
dissimilem not03 the look gave no

indication os the taste.
29. passeris, a flat fish compared by
Plin. N. H. 9. 36 to the ‘ rhombus.7

Bentley would read for ‘atque' ‘ assi et‚'
which Lambinus had found in some
MSS„ ofwhat age it is not said. Heind.
follows him.

ut vel continuo patuit. Prof.
Palmer proposes to give more point to
this by taking ‘ingustata' to mean
‘ without tasting‚’ i.e. the strangeness of
the flavour became apparent to an
earlier sense ; but this is perhaps broader
humour than Horace intends. The un—
initiated wanted a guide, sor neither the
look of the dishes nor their previous
experience prepared them sor the mani-
fold surprises. Fundanius learned this
early when he was handed this dish
‘ which he had never tasted before.’
The words are carefully chosen to em-
phasize the novelty of the cookery and
avoid any expression either of approval
or disapproval.

30. porrexerat. The subj. is the host.

31. melimela, ‘honey apples,' ‘ dul-
cibus aut certent quae melimela favis ’
Mart. Ι. 44. 4 ; a special kind of sweet
a le.
Prphinorem ad lunam, by moonhght,
and when the moon was waning.
