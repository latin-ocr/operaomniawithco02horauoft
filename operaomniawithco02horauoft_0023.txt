TO THE SATIRES. 11

on his travels‚ as Aufidius Luscus, the jack in office at Fundi¹3 some
of the money-lenders well known about the Forum, and who could
hardly strike again atafriend ofMaecenas‚ Nerius, Perillius with his nick-
name of Cicuta ², the ‘younger of the Novii,'the sight of whom accounts
for the look of pain or the uplifted hand of Marsyas' statue ³3 some¹
‘ scurrae ',· such a scornful list of the scum of society as in Sat. 1. 8. 39.

There are cases again in which we obviously have allusions to
anecdotes or characters which were public property, not meant
maliciously, but the employment by way of illustration of what
was already in everyone's mouth. Such are for instance Labeo the
type of a madman ⁴, Albucius and his poison, Scaeva and his long-
lived mother, Turius the severe -judge 5. It is possible again that
where stories or traits which reflect discredit are given the names
may be the veils of known persons more or less transparent to
Horace⁷s contemporaries or his immediate circle.

But there are two sources of his anecdotes and of his names, which,
though we cannot measure exactly how much is due to each, are
certainly answerable for a good many, and which so far as they go
show that his purpose was genuinely to illustrate and vivify his moral
descriptions‚ not to give pain or teach the world to sneer.

1. It is certain that many of his stories and instances belong
really to the last generationss. His satirical sketch of Tigellius'
character in Sat. 1. 2. and 3 (which in the latter satire he makes
typical of his satiric style) relates to one who was already dead.
Fausta, ‘the daughter of Sulla‚'takes at least one scandal of Sat. 1. 2
some years back. Arbuscula the mime-actress, and the son of
Aesopus, of whom stories are told in 1. 10. 77 and 2. 3. 239, are
persons known to us in Cicero's letters. The reference to Alfenus
in 1. 3. 130, whoever be the person, is by the tense of ‘ erat' thrown
back to a date antecedent to the text. So is the story of Staberius⁷
will in 2. 3. 84 f., with the further indication that the ‘ epulum arbitrio
Arri’ is to be illustrated from an anecdote told by Cicero in Vatin.
