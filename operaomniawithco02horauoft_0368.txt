Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent.

culture came from Greece. the con-
queror learning from the conquered, that
therefore it came late; that roughness
was the original characteristic of Roman
literature slowly subdued, and never
wholly lost. The point of ‘Graecia
capta’ is therefore not to fix a date,
whether it be the complete conquest of
Greece in B.C. 146, or the expulsion of
Pyrrhus and the capture of Tarentum
in B.C. 275, 272, though both of these
were epoehs in the conquest and re—
conquest.

158. numerus Saturnius: the native
Italian measure, in which Livius An-
dronicus wrote his adaptation of the
Odyssey and Naevius his poem on the
Punic war, but which was driven from
the field by the Greek metres introduced
by Ennius and later poets. A popular
account of it is to be found in the
preface to Macaulay’s Lays of Ancient
Rome. Its irregularity struck those
who had become familiar with Greek
metres. Many attempts have been
made to reduce to metrical law the
specimens of the verse which we have,
but it is coming to be believed (see
Nettleship‚ Journ. of Phil. ii. p. 184)
that (as is perhaps implied in the words
of Servius on Virg. G. 2. 385 ‘ Saturnio
metro . . . quod ad rhythmum solum
vulgares componere colebant 'J it rested
on aecent, not 011 quantity. With the
epithet ‘horridus’ cp. Virgil's (l. c.)
‘ versibus incomptis,' and Ennius' (Ann.
7. Ι) ‘ versibus quos olim Fauni vatesque
canebant Cum neque Musarum scopulos
quisquam superarat Nec dicti studiosus
erat.'

defluxit, ‘the stream ran dry '; Epp.

virus, ‘rankness'3 offences against
good taste.

160. hodieque manent. As time
has not spared to us the writings of

which Horace speaks, we cannot esti—
mate the ‘rusticity' of which he com-
plains.

161—167. The Scholiasts were no
doubt right in taking the subject through-
out these lines to be the ‘ ferus victor’
of v. 156, ‘the Roman’; the last four
would suit perhaps more easily a per-
sonal subject, such as Accius or Pacu·
vius; but unless the text is faulty they
cannot be separated from the first three,
and in these Horace is evidently speak—
ing of the people. There is a touch of
irony in ‘acumina‚' ‘quid utile,’ after
the description of their rusticity, the
sharpness of their wit set to discover
how Aeschylus, etc. could help them (τί
προῦργου φέροι).

162. post Punica bella quietus:
when at rest after the wars with Car-
thage. Horace is perhaps thinking, so
far as he particularized at all, of the
period following the second Punic war,
from B.C. 201, not taking account of
the third, B.C. 146, since an active study
of Greek literature went on in the early
part of the second century B.C.; Aul.
Gellius (17. 21. 45³ quotes from Porcius
Licinus the line ‘ Poenico bello secundo
Musa pinnato gradu Intulit se belli-
cosam in Romuli gentem feram.'

163. Sophocles et, Thespis et
Aeschylus. The three names repre-
sent Attic tragedy. Thespis is inserted
as the traditional founder of it (see A.
P. 276), though we are not to suppose
that plays of his were studied by the
Romans. Euripides, who was their real
favourite (Quintil. 10. 1. 68), is omitted,
possibly, as Pros. Wilkins says, for his
unmetrical name.

164. ‘He went on to make essay
whether he could worthily translate
them.’ Schiitz parallels the constr. from
Livy 1. 57 ‘temptata res est, si capi
Ardea posset,' so id. 2. 35.
