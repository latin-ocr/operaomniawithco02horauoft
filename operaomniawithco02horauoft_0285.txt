LIB. I.

EPIST. 12.

271

Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors,

Empedocles an Stertinium deliret acumen. 20
Verum seu pisces seu porrum et caepe trucidas

Utere Pompeio Grospho, et si quid petet ultro

Defer; nil Grosphus nisi verum orabit et aequum.

Vilis amicorum est annona bonis ubi quid deest.

Ne tamen ignores quo sit Romana loco res: 25
Cantaber Agrippae, Claudi virtute Neronis

premat ‘hides in darkness? It is prob-
ably of the monthly changes of the moon
(Prop. l. c. v. 27 ‘ unde coactis Cornibus
in plenam menstrua luna redit') rather
than of eclipses.

19. quid velit et possit, ‘the pur-
pose and effects.’

eoncordia discors, ⁵ harmony in dis-
cord.’ The reference is to the two
κινὴσεως ἀρχαί, νεῖκος καὶ φιλία, to which
Empedocles (Arist. Metaphys. 1. 4)
traced the origin of things Cp. Cic.
de Am. 7. 24 ⁸ quae in rerum natura
totoque mundo constarent quaeque
moverentur ea contrahere amicitiam, dis-
sipare discordiam ’ with Dr. Reid's notes.
For the oxymoron cp. ‘ strenua inertia '
in the last Epistle. The phrase recurs
in later writers as Ov. Met. 1. 433 ‘discors
concordia foetibus apta est.'

20. Empedocles, of Agrigentum,
A. P. 465. He wrote a long poem in
hexameters on Nature, fragments of which
remain. Lucretius speaks of it with
enthusiasm (1. 717 foll.) and looked on
it as his model.

Stertinium acumen. For the ad-
jectival use of the gentile name, ‘ Ster-
tinium ' = ‘ Stertinianum,’ cp. ‘ Sulpiciis
horreis’ Od. 4. 12. 18. It is an exten-
sion of the practice in prose, which is
limited (acc. to Madv. ξ 189), when the
name is used of an individual‚ to public
and official relations and undertakings,
‘leges Iuliae‚’ ‘ via Appia ’ and the like.
Cp. the similar liberty taken with tribal
names, ‘ Marsus aper' and individual
names ‘Romula gens ’ see on Od. 1. 15.
10. For Stertinius see introd. to Sat. 2.
3. Like the ‘ sapientum octavus ’ of
that Satire (v. 296) this treatment of him
as the representative of Stoicism is in
Jest.

deliret: Epp. 1. 2. 14. This strong
word is used prob. in reference to the
charges of madness flung about so freely
by Stoie teachers on which that Satire

tums, ‘or whether it is the philosopher
who calls us all crazed who is crazed
himself.’

21. The tone of banter begun in the
last line is continued in this.

verum, σὺ δ’ οὖν, ‘ to turn to the
practica] matter? ‘Whatever be your
position in philosophy or the principles
which you draw from it for your table
(referring back to vv. 7, ὃὸ, whether it
allows you as a Stoie to eat fish, or, as a
true Pythagorean,makes you feel it almost
murder to eat a vegetable . . ‚²

pisces. 1t is doubtful whether fish
are named as a luxury (this was perhaps
the Scholiast’s understanding of it ; ⁶ seu
laute sive parce vivis ') or as specially
forbidden to Pythagoreans; Athenaeus,
p. 161 οἱ πυθαγορίζοντες ’γὰρ ὡς ἀκούομεν
Ι οὔτ’ ὄψον ἐσθίουσιν, οὔτ’ ἄλλ’ οὐδὲ ἓν Ι
ἔμψυχον.

porrum et caepe trucidas, imitated
by Juv. S. 15. 9 ‘ Porruni et caepe nefas
violare et frangere morsu.' For Horace’s
jests on the vegetarianism of Pythago-
reans see on Sat. 2. 6. 63.

22. utere, as in Epp. 1.17. 2 and 14,
sc. ‘ familiariter ' 3 ‘ make a friend of.'

Pompeio Grospho: see introd. to
Od. 2. 15.

ultro, ‘ readily,’ as though you had
thought of it first.

23. verum ε Epp. 1. 7. 98, as Schiitz
suggests, perhaps here as a touch of
philosophical jargon, the word that
Iccius himself might be supposed to
use.

24. ⁵ Friends are cheap in the market
when good men are lacking something,'
1. e. to do a service (as you may now do)
to a good man is an easy way of gaining
a friend. It is a rendering of Socrates'
saying (Xen. Mem. 2. 10. 45 οἱ μέντοι
ἀγαθοὶ οἰκονόμοι, ὅταν τὸ πολλοῦ ἄξιον
μικροῦ ἐξῇ πρίασθαι τότε φασὶ δεῖν ὠνεῖ·
σθαι· νῦν δὲ διὰ τὰ πράγματα εὐωνοτάτους
ἔστι φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσασθαι.
