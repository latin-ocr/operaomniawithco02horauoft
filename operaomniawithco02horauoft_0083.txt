SATIRE VI.

THE FREEDMAN’s soN.

Verses 1-6. YOUR princely Etruscan lineage does not lead you, Maecenas, to
do what many do, despise such humbly born people as me the ‘freedman’s
son.’

7-18. You think ifa man is himself free born it matters little what his parents
were, and your historieal reasoning is sound ; Servius Tullius was not the first
of no ancestry who lived honourably and climbed to great position; on the
other hand not ‘ all the blood os all ⁷ the Valerii made even the Roman people,
for all their worship of ancestry‚ think Laevinus worth anything. How much
sounder should our judging be !

19—26. It is no doubt all sair in political matters. It serves me right, ifI, though a
Decius, am rejected in favour of a Laevinus, or isan Appius as Censor strikes
me off the senate. Why can’t Ι be contented with my own place? But the
well born have no monopoly os foolish ambition. You, Tillius. had better have
rested without trying to regain your tribune's rank. You were less exposed to
envy.

27—44. When a man gains a public position he makes the world ask about his
birth, as a man who sets up as a good-looking fellow makes them pull his
features to pieees. ‘ A slave's son going to order the execution of citizens ³?
‘Nay‚ Novius my colleague is a rank lower still? ‘That does not make
you an aristocrat. Besides he has a stentorian voice, that is his claim
on us.’

45-64. To go back to myself. People carped at me as ‘ a freedman’s son ’ when Ι
was a military tribune. They do so now because Ι am admitted to your
house. The first perhaps was fair, the second is not. There was no luck
about it. It was no chance introduction. Virgil and Varius told you what
Ι was like. When Ι was introduced to you I was too much abashed to say
much, but at least I made no pretensions. 1 said what was true about my
birth and state. You answered little, but nine months after you sent for me
and gave me a place in your friendship. Ι value this because I take it as a
compliment not to my birth but to myself.

65—84. At the same time any merits of character that I possess, I am eager to
acknowledge, I owe to my father. Poor as he was he insisted on giving me
the best education. He brought me to Rome, spared nothing on me, would
trust me to no ‘ custos ’ but himself. He guarded me not only from actual evil
but from breath of reproach.

85—97. He did not mind if it ended in my coming down to his own trade aster all
—I have not done so, and Ι owe him all the more credit and thanks. Never
in my senses could I be ashamed of such a father. Ι have no inclination to
apologize sor him. I would not change him if I could.

98—109. The world may think this madness, but you will perhaps think it a proof
of sense; for position brings burdens, duties, expenses. Now I may live as

} Ι like; no one will accuse me of meanness as they do Tillius.
110. 1 am freer than lie—1 wall< out alone, amuse myself as I choose; corne
