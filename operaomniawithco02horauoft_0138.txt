HORATII SATIRARUM

Quinquennes oleas est et silvestria corna,

Ac nisi mutatum parcit defundere vinum, et

Cuius odorem olei nequeas perferre, licebit

Ille repotia natales aliosve dierum 60
Festos albatus celebret, cornu ipse bilibri

Caulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.

Quali igitur victu sapiens utetur, et horum

Utrum imitabitur? Hac urget lupus, hac canis, aiunt.
Mundus erit qua non offendat sordibus, atque 65

In neutram partem cultus miser.

Hic neque servis,

Albuci senis exemplo, dum munia didit

Saevus erit; nec sic ut simplex Naevius unctam

Convivis praebebit aquam; vitium hoc quoque magnum.
Accipe nunc victus tenuis quae quantaque secum 70

58. mutatum. Sat. 2. S. 503 ‘tumed
to vinegar.⁷

defundere. Od. 4. 5. 34.

59. cuius odorem olei, i. e. ‘ oleum
cuius odorem.’ See on Epod. 2. 57.

licebit. Epod. 15. 19,

60. repotia, ‘ second drinkings'3 the
name, according to one of the Scholiast's
notes, ofthe day aster the wedfflng, when
there was feasting at the bridegroom's
house; according to another of them, of
the seventh day, when the bride revisited
her parents.

alios dierum. Cp. ‘ vanis rerum '
supr. v. 25.

61. albatus, with a new or sreshly
cleaned toga—in holiday dress. Cicero
in Vatin. 1 3. 31 ¹ cum ipse epuli dominus
albatus esset.' So of the proper dress
for visiting a temple, Pers. S. 2. 40.

62. veteris non parcus aceti. A
receipt for a miser's salad—the oil bad,
and even then very carefully measured,
the vinegar good (the old is the sourest)
and in plenty. As Schutz suggests, it
is a parable of the host's character: and
the dressing secures that very little os
the salad will be eaten. Others take
the words as referring back to v. 58,
‘aceti ’ being substituted παρὰ προσ-
δοκίαν for ‘vini '; but this does not give
as much point.

64. ‘ Proverbium est ubi duae res rno-
lestae sunt ¹ Acr. The proverb is adapted
to the two characters offered, the ‘ gula
Harpyiis digna,' and the ‘canis' of v.

65. mundus erit. The subj. is
‘sapiens'

qua must be explained With the
Scholiasts and Bentley as=‘quatenus,'
i. e. ‘eatenus ut,’ to such an extent as
not to ofsend by signs of meanness.'
‘ Qua' was the reading of all the Bland
MSS. ‘
would have the same sense.
fendit ' or ‘offendet’ (which makes the
words a definition of ⁴ mundus') chiefly
occupied the text before Bentley, but
has little authority. The thought is
familiar in Horace. Cp. Od. 2. 10. 6-8,
2. 16. 13—16.

66. in neutram partem, ‘in neither
direction.’

cultus, ‘style of living'; ef. Virg.
Aen. 3. 591 ‘miseranda cultu! For
gen. in ‘cultus miser' see on Sat. 1.
. 11.
9 67. dum munia didit, i.e.notmerely
when they have actually offended. ‘ Di-
dere’ is a Lucretian word. Albucius

Qui ' has inferior authority. It

may be the same person who is named
in Sat. 2. 1. 48, q. v.; but there is no>
thing to help us. It is a name in Lu—

decencies of hospitality.

unctam, ‘ greasy,’ Sat. 2. 4. 78.

69. praebebit aquam: Sat. 1. 4.
