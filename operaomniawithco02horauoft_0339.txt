1. Vertumnum Ianumque. A sta-

tue of Vertumnus stood at the end of

the Vicus Tuscus, where it joined the
Forum (Prope-rt. 4. 2. 6). It seems to
be implied that there were booksellers'
stalls in the neighbourhood of it. Janus
has been taken here either for the arches
in the Forum (see on Sat. 2. 3. 18) or
for the temple attributed to Numa, which
stood in the Argiletum. This is known
to have been a booksellers’ quarter; see
especially Mart. Ι. 4. 1 (to his own
book, in imitation of this Epistle) ‘Ar-
giletanas mavis habitare tabernas?
spectare, ‘to look wistfully at.'

2. seilicet, calls ironica] attention to
the motive named, ‘in order—save the
mark !—that‚’ etc.‚ as Sat. 2. 5. 87, Epp.
1. 9. 3.

prostes, be set out for sale on the
bookseller's stall.

Sosiorum: A.P. 345: ‘ Sosii illo tem-
pore fratres erant bibliopolae celeberrimi⁷
Por h.

pirmice mundus. Cp. Catull. r. 1
‘novum libellum arido modo pumice
expolitum‚' 22. 8 ‘pumice omnia
aequata.' Explained by Munro of the
smoothing of the edge of the papyrus
when rolled up tightly <Criticisms and
Elucidations of Catullus, p. 545.

3. claves . . . sigilla. It was a cus-
tom to seal as well as lock the cases in
which things of especial value were
stowed away, as in the master's absence.
Cp. Aesch. Agam. 614 of the faithful
wife, σημαντήριον οὐδὲν διαφθείρασαν. So
Martia] tl. 67. 5 foll.) to a plagiarist
of compositions not yet published, and
with a figure perhaps suggested by these
lines ‘ Secreta quaere carmina et rudes
emas Quas novit unus scrinioque signatas
Custodit ipse virginis pater chartae.’ Cp.

A. P. 388.

4. eommunia=‘ vitam cominunem,'
‘ life in public.'

5. non ita nutritus. The book has
not been prepared for publication by
being generally ‘ recited.’ For Horace's
practice see Sat. 1. 4v 7 3.

fuge. The meaning is made clear by
Martial’s imitation 1. 4. 11 ‘ Aetherias,
lascive, cupis, volitare per auras: I,
fuge, sed poteras tutior esse domi.' The
word specially suits the figure of a slave
who contemplates running away: cp.
v. 13 ‘fugies'

descendere: see on Od. 3. 1. 11 and
cp. ⁶ deferar’ Epp. 2. 1. 269.

6. non erit, ‘go, remembering the
condition on which you go-—there is no
recalling the step.'

emisso is used in its simple sense
(cp. Epp. 1. 18. 71), but with refer-
ence also to a technical sense of ⁶ pub-
lishing ⁷ a book. See L. & S. s. V.

7. ubi quis, etc.‚ ‘when you meet
with hostile c1·itieism,orfind that friendly
readers tire of you.' et scis follows
laeserit rather awkwardly, but the only
alternative is to make it an independent
sentence, and (as Ritter says) the book
is not yet published, and therefore does
not ‘know.⁷

8. in breve te cogi : the opposite of
‘ evolvi ’ ; to be rolled up tight and put
back in the case.

plenus languet. Cf. ‘languidus iam
conviva’ Sat. 2. 4. 39.

9. ‘ If my annoyance at your solly
does not make me read your future too
gloomily.' The irony is obvious.

10 aetas, used here, like ὥρα, for
‘the prime of life?

1 1. sordescere: to grow dirty from the
thumbing ofthe vulgar. Cp. Sat. 1.4. 7 2.
