HORATII EPISTULARUM

Sunt verba et voces quibus hunc lenire dolorem

Possis et magnam morbi deponere partem. 35
Laudis amore tumes3 sunt certa piacula quae te

Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.

Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator,

Nemo adeo ferus est ut non mitescere possit,
Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem. 40
Virtus est vitium fugere et sapientia prima

Stultitia caruisse.

Vides quae maxima credis

Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam, ·’

Quanto devites animi capitisque labore.

Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes:

avaritia’ pro Quint. 11. 38, or Ovid's ’ 22. 10 (12) ‘radix caste pureque col-

‘ tumida fervebat ab ira' Met. 2. 602;
‘ is in a ferment.' For the indicative of
hypothesis cp. inf. v. 58 and 87.

misero: Sat. 1. 4. 26 ‘ob avaritiam
aut misera ambitione laborat,’ ib. 1. 6.
129.

cupidine z a larger word than
‘avaritia,' including all the ways of
desiring instead of enjoying, os which
that is (to Horace) the standing instance.
See introd. to Sat. Ι. 1. Cp. the phrase
‘inops cupido ' in Epp. Ι. 18. 98. For
the gender of ‘cupido' see on Od.
2. 16. 15.

34. verba et voees: perhaps with
remembrance of Eur. Hipp. 478 εἰσὶν
δ’ ἐπῳδαῖ καὶ λό’γοι θελκτήρια· 1 φανή-

σεταί τι τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσου, where . . .

ἐπῳδαί would answer to ‘voces,' λόγοι
to ‘verbas The teachings of philosophy
are likened to the spells of the ἰατρό-
μαντις.

36. laudis amore: ambition stands
next to avarice, as in Sat. 1. 4. 26,
2. 3. 179 f011.; Epp. 2. 2. 205.

tumes, as Sat. 2. 3. 213. The choice
of the figure is due to the windy, un-
substantiaL character of the objects of
ambition, ‘inani ambitione⁷ Epp. 2. 2.
206. But it is also another medical
word, ambition is as a dropsy.

piacula: continuing the figure of
ancient medicine, which mixed the arts
of the physician and of the seer.

37. ter: see note on Sat. 2. 1. 7.

medical and religious import. Plin. N. H.

libello. The word covers both the
philosophical treatise and the book of
magic formulae to which it is likened.
41. virtus.
is usual with Horace, to understand

‘prima ' from the second substantive. ‘2

‘ It is a first step in virtue to avoid vice,
as it is the first step in wisdom to have
got rid of folly.' He is still apologiz-
ing for the elementary and negative
character of the wisdom which is to
come.

43. censum . . . repulsam. These
follow the order ofthe two vices ofwhich
he has spoken, avarice and ambition.

turpem : cp. Od. 3. 2. 17 ‘ repulsae
sordidae.'

44. animi capitisque labore. A
difficulty was early felt in the apparent
contrast of ‘animi ' and ‘ capitis.' Our
opposition of ⁴ heart⁷ and ‘head ' is not
to be thought of. The true explana-
tion is probably indicated in the early
glosses which have in some MSS. crept
into the text as substitutes sor ‘ la-
bore,’ (1‘) ‘d0101-e‚⁷ i.e. ‘labor' means
‘ pain' rather than ‘ effort’; (2) ‘ periclo,’
i. e. ‘labor' is used with something os
a zeugma, ‘ capitis labore ’ having rather
the sense of ‘risk 'to life!

46. per mare . . . per saxa, per
ignes. The enumeration is proverbial
and metaphorical, though it begins with
a danger which may be understood
litei-ally. Cp. Sat. 1. 1. 38, 2. 3. 54.
With the general picture of the trader
cp. Od. 3. 24. 36 soll.
