268 HORATII EPISTULARUM

greater or 1655,’ etc., as though ‘ve’ could be used in alternative interrogation,
but ‘ are they either greater or less?’ 1. e. ‘are they just what the world says, or
either greater or U‘ ve '’) less? ' (2) Keller with the same punctuation understands
a repeated ‘Quid’z ‘ what of Smyrna and Colophon? [what] of towns greater
or less in repnte ¹? ' ‘ fama ' being in this rendering an abl. not of comparison but
of the ‘part concerned.’ (33 Orelli and Dillr. remove the stop at ‘ sama‚' con-
necting the words ‘ maiora‚' etc. with the following line z ‘Be they greater or less
than their repnte, do all alike pale before the Campus and Tiber stream?' In
this interpretation also ‘ fama ' may be taken for ‘ in repnte‚' instead of‘ than their
reputes (4) Sch'utz removes the question at ‘Colophon,’ retains it at ‘ sama?’
The words ‘maiora . . . sama’ then become the qualification grammatically of
‘Smyrna et Colophon,’ answering to the more special epithets which have been
given to Chios and Lesbos, Samos and Sardis. ‘ What of Smyrna and Colophon,
greater places or (it may be) smaller than the world thinks them? ' This is the
view, substantially, taken in the note.

EPISTLE XII.

TO ICCIUS.

Tffls Epistle brings together the Iccius of Od. 1. 29 and the Pompeius
Grosphus of md. 2. 16. The purpose is in the first instance personal—-to intro-
duce Grosphus to Iccius. who is acting as ‘procurator' in charge of Agrippa’s
Siciliam estates. It is to be noticed that Grosphus seems when the Ode (see
vv. 33-37> was written to have been a wealthy proprietor in Sicily. He is now
returning to the island, and is in a position, we know not how, in which Iccius
may be able to help him.

The Epistle also implies that Iccius has complained (either in a letter to
Horace or otherwise) that he is managing the estate of another rather than an
independent property of his own. The poet rallies him gently for this (vv. 1-16),
turning his remonstrance into compliments on the simple life which no increase
of wealth would affeet (vv. 7-11), and the maintenance of high philosophical
interests in a post where there was so much to foster a greed ofgain (vv. 12-20).
From this he passes lightly (v. 21) to the introduction and commendation of
Grosphus (vv. 22—24). The Epistle ends with some lines (vv. 25—29), of which
the professed purpose is to give the news from Rome, but which, if we suppose
such an Epistle to be written for a larger circle of readers, associate with it the
names, in a climax, of Agrippa, Tiberius, Augustus, and flood the picture as with
the light osa returning golden age.

The last lines should also incidentally fix the date of the Epistle. With respect
to the difficulty caused by the reference to Agrippa’s conquest of the Cantabri
see general Introd. to the Episfles, p. 208.
