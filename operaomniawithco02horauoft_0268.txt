256 HORATII EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE VIII.

TO CELSUS ALBINOVANUS.

‘ GREET Celsus sor me, my Muse, the friend and secretary of Tiberius. If 110
asks after me, say that Ι am in my old way—with more intentioris than perform-
ances, well enough in estate and body, not so well in soul; unwilling to learn, or
take advice, unable to profit by experience or keep a purpose. Ask him how he
is, how he stands in favour with prince and staff. If he says “well‚” first wish
him joy, and then in his private ear whisper that he must not let his head be

turned by his fortune.⁷

We can hardly be wrong in thinking the last verse the gist of the Epistle.
Horace's half ironical confessions lead up to it. ‘ You may say worse of me than
Ι wish to suggest of you. 1 do not listen to my friends3 so I cannot eomplain if
you do not listen to me.’ We may compare the art with which a more tender
reproof is conveyed to Virgil in Odes 1. 24 (see introd.).

VVeichert (poetae Latini, p. 382) would distinguish the ‘Celsus Albinovanus'

of this Epistle from the ‘Celsus' of 1. 3. 15 f.; but he is driven to do so by his
view that those lines are meant harshly and contemptuously. In default of proof

they have too many points in common to be separated.

CELSO gaudere et bene rem gerere Albinovano

Musa rogata refer, comiti scribaeque Neronis.

Si quaeret quid agam, dic multa et pulchra minantem
Vivere nec recte nec suaviter3 haud quia grando
Contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus, 5
Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris3

3. minantem ε cp., both for the
verb and sor the description of himself,
Sat. 2. 3. 9 ‘voltus erat multa et prae-
clara minantis.'

4. nee reete neo suaviter. As
Sch'utz says, ‘ neither to the Stoie‘s
standard nor to the Epicurean's.' For
⁴ recte vivere ’ see on Epp. 1. 2. 41.

1. Albinovano. It is the cognomen
also of C. Pedo Albinovanus, the friend
of Ovid.

2. rogata, ‘ as 1 pray you.'

refer: deliver as your message. It
is followed by ‘gaudere et bene rem
gerere,' ‘ greeting and good wishes.’
Orelli says ‘ subaud. “ me eum iubere.'' '

 

 

Compare the use of χαίρειν in beginning
letters. ‘ Refer' 15 a proper equivalent
to ‘nuntia’; the Muse is to carry to
Celsus the wishes of Horace. It is not
therefore necessary to take it with Orelli
as=‘earry baek‚' as though the letter
were an answer to a letter from Celsus.
It may be so, but there 15 nothing to
indicate it.

Neronis: see on Epp. 1. 3. 2 and ep.
Epp. 2. 2. 1.

haud quia, etc. My troubles are not
those of the rich proprietor of vineyards
and oliveyards (cp. Od. 3. 1. 29-32) or
of herds who are driven as the season
changes from pasturage to pasturage
(cp. Epod. 1. 27, 28).

5. momorderit, ‘ have nipped or
blighted.’ ‘Mordere' is used of the
effect of cold in Sat. 2. 6. 45 ; of rough
wind, by Martial 8. 14. 2 ‘ mordeat et
tenerum fortior aura nemus?
