Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,

HORATII ARS POETICA.

180

Quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus, et quae
Ipse sibi tradit spectator: non tamen intus
Digna geri promes in scenam, multaque tolles
Ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praesens:

Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet,

Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus,
Aut in avem Procne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.
Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.
Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu

brought to an end in vv. 176-17S‚ this
being indicated (as in v. 152) by the
repetition of the chief point which has
been urged. We pass to some miscella-
neous practical rules for a writer os
plays. What is said of the distinction
between that which should be represented
in action on the stage and that which
should be reported by an ἄγγελος is
based exactly on the Greek practice.

179. in scenis ε for the plur. cp. Virg.
Aen. 1. 429, 4. 471, where see Coning-
ton's note.

180. The thought is an old one, and
had been enforced by Cicero in his
recommendation ofa ‘ memoria technica’
which made use of the eyes, de Or. 2.

demissa: Virg. Aen. 4. 428 ⁶ Cur mea
dicta negat duras demittere in aures 2 ’

181. fidelibus, gives the reason ;
we believe our eyes more than our ears.
Herod. Ι. 8 ὦτα ’γὰρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώποις
ἐόντα ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, Sen. Epp.
6. 4 ‘homines amplius oculis quam
auribus credunt.’

184. praesens, with narret, relates
in his presence, i.e. on the stage; ‘the
eloquent tongue’ of a messenger or (as
Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon) one of
the persons in the play.

185—188. Two classes of actions are
named as to be thus kept from the actual
view of the spectators; crimes which
shock (what Aristotle would call τὸ
μιαρόν Poet. 14. 7, which he allows‚ as
in the case of Medea's act, only when it
is redeemed by πάθος) and what he calls
τὸ τερατῶδες, ‘the marvellous’ (meta-
morphoses and the like), which he for-
bids to Tragedy tib. ξ 2). It is to be
noted that Sophocles wrote a ‘ Tereus ’
(to whose story Procne belongs, see
Od. 4. 12. 6 n.). Among Euripides'
fragments there is a couplet which is

thought to have come from a ‘ Cadmus‘
(fr. 122 Nauck) οἴμοι δράκων μοι ’γίγνεται
τό ’γ’ ἤμισυ“ 1 τέκνον περιπλάκηθι τῷ λοιπῷ
πατρί, and which in that case justifies
Horace's warning. See Sandys‘ note on
Bacchae 13 30.

185. ne: rightly restored from the
MSS. by Bentley in place of ‘ nec.' He
takes it (as in v. 339) as final, the fol-
lowing lines giving illustrations of the
purpose os the preceding precept.

188. incredulus odi: the adjective
seems to belong most to the second-named
class of incidents, the verb to the first.

189. Aristotle discusses (Poet. 8) the
proper length of a tragedy, but in rela-
tion to the plot, laying down the rule
that it must be of sufficient compass to
make the catastrophe probable, and not
so long as to overtax the memory and
lose unity of view (τὸ εὐσύνοπτον).
Horace is adopting, perhaps after Alex—
andrine critics, a more mechanical
measurement. Our knowledge hardly
enables us to determine the exact rela-
tion of his words to previous Roman
practice or phraseology. A Greek
tragedy was divided ¹tArist. Poet. 12,
though this is possibly an interpolated
chapter) into πρόλογος, ἐπεισόδιον, ἔξοδος,
χορικὸν, a particular ἐπεισόδιον being the
portion of dialogue between two choral
odes. Horace uses ‘ actus’ in v. 194 as
the Roman equix-alent sor these divi-
sions. The number however of the
ἐπεισόδια in extant Greek tragedies
varies greatly, making with the πρόλογος
and ἔξοδος as many as eight ‘actus' in
some plays, as few as four in others.
In the only complete Latin tragedies
which we have, those os Seneca, H orace‘s
rule of a quintuple division is followed,
there being four choral odes. Cicero uses
the word ‘ actus’ frequently with refer-
ence (metaphorieal) to the divisions os
