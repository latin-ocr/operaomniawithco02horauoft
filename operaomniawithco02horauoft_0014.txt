2 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

literary, and in the background of circumstance. In Book I Octa-
vianus is mentioned only once and then incidentally as patron of
Tigellius. In Book II he is set in the forefront as the person
to whom compliments are to be paid and whose protection the
¹* poet may look for ¹. In Book Ι the friendship of Maecenas
occupies a prominent place, but there is no hint of his most valued
gift, the Sabine retreat. In Book II the ‘villa' is the scene of Sat. 3,
and the theme of Sat. 6. The peace of his country home has passed
into the poet's blood, and the assured position of which it was the
outward sign has modified his views of things. In 2. 1 he professes
to take up the cudgels on behalf of outspoken Safire, but he meets
his critics more than half-way. He is ‘cupidus pacis,' and his
weapon is to be one of defence only. Whatever of personality there
had been in Book I has been yet further toned down in Book II.
Horace's literary enemies Tigellius, Fannius, Demetrius, have had
their final dismissal in Sat. 1. 10. Though, as we see from his later
writings, his judgment on the general question between the ancients
and moderns remains what it was, he is no longer concerned to
defend himself against detractors who depreciated him by exalting
Lucilius3 and accordingly he expresses his debt to his predecessor
and his admiration for him without qualification.

ἓ 2. Date of Book I.

The first Book of the Satires is the first collection of Horace's
poems that was given to the world. This would be the natural con-
clusion from his words in Sat. 1. 10. 46, where, after assigning dif-
ferent kinds of poetry to different contemporary masters, he says of
Satire ‘ Hoc erat experto frustra Varrone Atacino Atque quibusdam
aliis melius quod scribere possem.' Some of the Epodes may
have been as early in composition as the earliest Satires, but the
collected Epodes were not published before the battle of Actium
(Epod. 9).

In endeavouring to fix the date of the publication of Sat. I it is of
the first importance to fix the time of Horace’s introduction to the
friendship of Maecenas. Six, if not seven ², of the ten Satires con-
tain references to that friendship. The friendship is fresh, and yet
