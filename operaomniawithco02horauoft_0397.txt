LIB. II.

Cum vitio fugere?
Ambitione ?

EPIST. 2.

381

Caret tibi pectus inani
Caret mortis formidine et ira?

Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,

Nocturnos lemures portentaque Thessala rides?

Natales grate numeras?

Ignoscis amicis?

210

Lenior et melior fis accedente senecta?

Quid te exempta iuvat spinis de pluribus una?
Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.

Lusisti satis, edisti satis atque bibisti:

Tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius aequo

215

Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius aetas.

206. fugere. Many of the best MSS.
(including the Bland.) give ‘ fuge 1·ite,’
and Porph, possibly read the same, for
his note ‘sic pronuntiandum est ut in-
telligetur 11011 fugisse alia vitia' seems
rnore needed in that case. Bentley’s last
judgment was in favour of this reading.
Keller, thinking with all recent editors,
that it was an error, ingeniously traces it
to an original blunder of ‘ fugerunt,⁷ this
corrected to ‘fugere,' but the ‘e' so
written above as to be taken by a fresh
blunder as an addition instead of a sub-
stitution, and the reading then deter-
mined by an unhappy remembrance of
V. 78 of this Epistle, ‘sugit urbes Rite
cliens Bacchi,' the copyist taking ‘ rite'
there to belong to ‘ fugit.‘

207. formidine et ira. Schiilz
seems right in taking these words to-
gether as both belonging to ‘ mortis,'
‘ terror and anger at death) He shows
that the use of ‘ira' with an obj. geni-
tive is common (as Liv. 1. 5 ‘ob irarn
praedae amissae') ; and for the idea he
refers to Lucret. 3. 1045 ‘ Tu vero du-
bitabis et indignabere obire.’ Temper‚
generally, is named in vv. 210, 211.

208. terrores magicos. Cp. Epp.
2. 1. 212 ‘falsis terroribus implet, Ut
magus.'

sagas: Od. 1. 27. 21.

209. lemures: Pers. S. 5. 185 ‘tum
nigri 1611111165.γ

Thessala. Thessaly was the land of
soreery; Od. 1. 27. 22, Epod. 5. 21. 45.

210. grate. ‘ with gratitude ’ (‘ lucro
apponens’ Od. 1. o. 145, ‘for what you
have had, not with repining that the

end is so much nearer.’

212. quid te iuvat, ‘What does it
profit you? ' ‘Iuvat ' is used of medical
help C. S. 63 ‘ qui salutari iuvat arte
fessos! ‘Levat,' which is given by
many edd. besides Bent.‚ has slight MS.
authority, the chief being that it is sup-
posed to have been the reading of three
of the ssland. MSS. (this, according to
Cruquius' mode of indication, does not
imply V). Ritter, however, shows that
Cruquius’ note by no means makes
it certain that he found ‘levat ³ in those
MSS. His words refer to the punctua-
tion, not to the verb: ‘sie habent cod.
Bland. tres per interrogationis notam:
quasi dicat, una spina de pluribus ex-
emta, nimirum avaritia, me levat mi-
nime.' He is justifying the repeated
note of interrogation at ‘quid?’ and
at ‘una?⁷ and pointing out that this is
equivalent to a negative ‘ minime '; ‘ le-
vat' may possibly be a natural slip of
his own. Keller and Munro have
⁶ iuvat.’ For ‘spinis' cp. Epp. 1. 14. 4
‘ spinas animo . . . evellas,' the metaphor
from weeding ground.

213. vivere recte: see on Epp. 1.
2. 4, 1. 6. 29, 1. 16. 17.

decede : with dat. ‘ make roorn for.'

214. For the picture of the ‘ conviva
satur,' who should know when to retire
from the banquet, see Sat. Ι. 1. 119.
The reference in both places is to
Lucret. 3. 938.

216. lasciva decentius, ‘in whom
play is inore becoming '; the picture of

Od. 3. 15.
