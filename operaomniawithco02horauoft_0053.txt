LIB. Ι.

Tardo cognomen, pingui, damus.

SAT. 3. 4¹

Hic fugit omnes

Insidias nullique malo latus obdit apertum,

Cum genus hoc inter vitae versemur ubi acris 60
Invidia atque vigent ubi crimina3 pro bene sano

Ac non incauto fictum astutumque vocamus.

Simplicior quis et est, qualem me saepe libenter

Obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem

Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus; 65

‘Communi sensu plane caret‚'

inquimus. Eheu,

Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam!

virtue. On the other hand, although it
is true that ‘ demissus ’ is used sometimes
in a bad sense, it is used as often in a
good sense for ‘unassuming‚' and is
especially connected in this sense with
‘probus' and equivalent terms, as in Cic.
de Or. 2. 43. 182 ‘ea omnia quae pro-
borum, demissorum, non acrium sunt,
benevolentiam conciliant’ ; pro Mur. 40.
87 ‘sit apud vos modestiae locus, sit
demissis hominibus persugium.' Bent-
ley quotes, from Quintilian 6. 5, a
sentence in which ‘imbecillitas ’ is
said to be mistaken for ‘probitas,’ and
one from Plutarch (‘Artaxerxes') in
which μέλλησις (z ‘ tarditas ³) is said to
have passed for ἐπιείκεια (‘probitas‘).
The construction which he supposes of
‘multum demissus homo ille‚⁷ ‘an un-
assuming man,‘ may be paralleled in
Od. 4. 9. 51 ‘non ille . . . timidus.' It
is unnecessary to do violence to the
MSS. by inserting ‘ ac ' ; the asyndeton
helps the sense of climax. Those who
adopt the other view make ‘multum
demissus homo' the judgment of the
censorious. ‘If we have amongst our
friends a man of sober worth, he is of a
poor spirit 3 to another who is slow we
give the niekname of stupid.' We may
well prefer Bentley's interpretation
though following the common reading.
With ‘ multum demissus ' cp. ⁶ multum
celer’ Sat. 2. 3. 147, ‘multum similis’
Sat. 2. 5. 92, ⁴ multum dissimiles' Epp.
1. 10. 3, ‘multum diversa’ Epp. 2. 2. 62.

58. tardo . . . pingui. For the dat.
see Madv. § 246, Obs. z.

59. malo, probably masc.

60. versemur: So V (the other MSS.
having ‘ versetur ’) and Bentleyargues sor
it. Whichever reading is adopted ‘ hoc
genus vitae ’will probably implya general
condition of the present time, not any

special risk os the supposed person. For
the use of ‘hoc' see above on v. 30
‘ horum hominum.'

61. pro bene sano. Orelli quotes
from Liv. 22. 39 ‘ sine, timidum pro
cauto, tardum pro considerato, imbellem
pro perito belli vocent.’

63. simplicior quis et est. ‘Et'
couples< simplicior'and ‘ [talis] qualem.'
For the position cp. V. 61 and Sat. 1. 6.
65 ‘ Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea
paucis Mendosa est natura.'

libenter obtulerim, ⁴1 should never
mind having shown myself.' Some editors
in criticizing this passage have credited
Horace with less than his usual irony.

65. impellat. In the sense of‘ dis-
turb‚' ‘call his attention,’ much as its
frequent use with ‘aures’ Virg. G. 4.
349, Pers. Sat. 2. 21 ‘ Iovis aurem im-
pellere.' The reading has been ques—
tioned, though the MSS. are unanimous
and the glosses of the Schol. ‘ adloqua-
tur‚‘ ‘ interpellat‚’ seem to recog-
nize it. Bentley proposed ‘impediat,'
which he supported with great ingenuity,
but ‘tacitum impediat’ does not seem
likel .

663] communi sensu, ‘the social
sense,’ the added sense or tact which
comes from living with others and which
fits a mansor so living. There is an ex-
haustive account of the mennings of
‘ sensus communis‚’ both in classical
and in later Latin, in Sir W. Hamilton's
Notes on Reid (p. 756 foll). He pointed
out that this is its meaningin the present
passage as also in Cic. de Or. 1. 3. 12,
2. 16. 68, and Juv. Sat. 8. 73. Quintilian
(1. 2. 20) gives as a reason for preferring
a school education to home education
that a boy learns ‘sensus communis)
It prevents him from becoming, as we
say, an egotist.
