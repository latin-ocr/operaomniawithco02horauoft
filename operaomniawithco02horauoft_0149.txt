Te quicquam indignum;

SAT. 3. 137

pudor, inquit, te malus angit,

Insanos qui inter vereare insanus haberi. 40'
Primum nam inquiram quid sit furere: hoc si erit in te
Solo, nil verbi, pereas quin sortiter, addam.

Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri

Caecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex

Autumat.
Excepto sapiente tenet.

Insano posuere.

Haec populos, haec magnos formula reges 45
Nunc accipe, quare

Desipiant omnes aeque ac tu,
Velut silvis, ubi passim

qui tibi nomen

Palantes error certo de tramite pellit,

1116 sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum abit: unus utrique 50
Error, sed variis illudit partibusg hoc te

Crede modo insanum, nihilo ut sapientior ille,

Qui te deridet, caudam trahat.

39. pudor malus. The expression
reeurs 111 Epp. Ι. 16. 24: ‘malus‚' as infr.
vv. 43 and 78, is of the consequences,
‘ mischievous.⁷

angit, ‘ tortures⁷; the pain must be
extreme to have such a result.

40. insanos inter, ‘in a world os
madmen.’

41. primum inquiram. The Stoic
begins, in character, with a definition.

42. nil verbi: the gen. osan adj. is
rnore usual; but cp. Plaut. Bacch. 4. 8.
18 ‘ nihil lucri.'

pereas quin, ‘ to prevent your dy-
in .'

g43. et, quemcunque, as Ritter points
out, is a stronger statement than that
of the first clause, ‘ et ' having, as often,
the force of ‘and indeed,' so that it is
not necessary to supply ‘cunque' with
the first ‘ quem.’

44. caecum. The 65561166 of mad-
ness is the not seeing where you are

gogkgirysippi‚ infr. v. 287, Sat. 1. 3.

porticus, στοὰ ποικίλη, 111 which Zeno
and his successors taught, and from
which the sect was named.

grex: not as it is in Epp. 1. 4. 16
‘ Epicuri (le grege,’ with a special colour
on it from the context, but in the
general sense 111 which it is used in Epp.

a frequent word in Plautus, occurring
once in Terence, Horace, Catullus.

formula . . . tenet. Ritter seems
right in explaining this as a legal phrase;
‘this definition attaches.’ He quotes
from Cic. (le Off. 3. 14. 60, where ‘ formula ⁷
and ⁶ definitio' are used convertibly of
the legal definitior} osan offence.

populos . . . reges: of number and
rank; whole peoples, and from the pea—
sant to the prince, there is only one
exception.

48. passim palantes. These words
put shortly what is in the loHowing
words more fully described in its pro-
cess: ‘as in a forest3 when men lose
their way they miss the path, one on
one side, another on the other.’

51. variis partibus, ‘ on different
sides)

hoe modo: usually taken as = ‘ sic,'
answering to ‘velut’; ‘ut' then intro-
ducing a consequential clause. It is per-
haps better to let the ‘ sic⁷ which should
answer to ‘velut’ be understood, and
take ‘ hoc modo . . . ut ' together in the
sense of‘ita ut,' as limiting the scope
of ‘crede te insanum‚⁷ ‘to this extent,'
‘ 111 511611 a &5⁶25 only, that.'

53. caudam trahat. According to
the Scholiast a proverbial expression for
being a fool without knowing it : ‘solent
pueri nescientibus caudam suspendere ⁷ ;
the tail he explains to be a sheep’s tail.
The man who laughs at you for having
a tail tied to you, has one himself.
