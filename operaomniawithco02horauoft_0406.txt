HORATII ARS POETICA.

Spectatum admissi risum teneatis, amici? 5
Credite, Pisones, isti tabulae fore librum

Persimilem cuius, velut aegri somnia, vanae

Fingentur speeies, ut nec pes nec caput uni

Reddatur formae.

‘Pictoribus atque poetis

Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.’ 10
Scimus, et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim3
Sed non ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut

Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.

Inceptis gravibus plerumque et magna professis

PurpureuS, late qui splendeat, unus et alter 15
Adsuitur pannus, cum lucus et ara Dianae

Et properantis aquae per amoenos ambitus agros,

5. spectatum t i. e. to a private view.

8. speeies: ‘images‚' ‘conceptions.’
lt is limited presently to the total con-
ceptipn, the μῦθος, as we should say ‘the
plot’3 but it is here still general; w-hat
ever is imagined‚ a character, a scene,
a dialogue. Such‘ species' are ‘‚vanae'
κεναί, μάταιαι, when they have nothing
in reality to answer to them. This,
however, as Sch'utz points out, is limited
by the words that follow. A poet's
pictures must often have nothing in the
world of prose that answers to them;
what is condemned is so drawing these
pictures that they lack not only truth
of fact but truth of consistency.

nee pes nee caput: a proverbial
expression, like our ‘ neither head nor
tai1,‘ and not to be taken literally. It
stands here not for ‘no single part,'
which would make no sense with uni
formae, but for ‘ no two parts.'

9. reddatur: is made to correspond3
‘ reddere ’ is ‘ to give what is due.’

pictoribus atque poetis. This is,
as the Pseudo-Acron says, a ‘ subiectio ‘
οι· answer, supposed to be made by
some one. ⁴ Surely painters and poets
equally have the time honoured privi-
lege of unlimited audacity in invention. ’
The edd. quote Diphilus ap. Athen.
6.1 ὡς οἱ τραγῳδοί φασιν, οις ἐξουσίαΙ
ἔστιν λέγειν ἅπαντα και ποιεῖν μόνοις,
Arist. M.etaph 1. 2. ιοκατὰ τὴν παροιμίαν
Πολλὰ ψεύδονται ἀοιδοι, Lucian, pro
Imag. 18 (pelhaps ..in remembrance of
Horace) παλαιὸς οὗτος ὁ λόγος ἀνευ-
θύνους εἶναι και ποιητὰς και γραφέας.

10. aequa: as Aer. = ‘aequalia'
Orelli and Schiitz prefer to take it as
‘fain

11. petimusque damusque, ‘ we ask
as poem, and give as critics' Aer.

1 2, 13. ut placidis coeant immitia,
‘ that savage mate with tame) This and
the following are a second metaphorical
expression <the first being vv. 1—5) for
incongruous combinations, such as ig-
nore the lines of distinction which Na-
ture draws: cp. Epod. 16. 30.

14. Poets begin as though they were
in earnest and meant something great3
but the nierits of the piece turn out to
be two or three good descriptions of
scenery3 The ‘purple patch' implies
that it is stitched on a somewhat dingy
garment.

plerumque‚‘ very often? See on Sat.
1. 10 15

16.cum1ueus‚etc. Horace is hit-
ting some particular poems of the
day, and the clue' is lost to us. ‘Diana‘ s
grove and altar' may have been a scene
described in unnecessary detail in some
‘ Iphigenia,' or the Comm. Cruq. may
have had grounds for his assertion that
the reference is to an altar of Diana
Nemorensis at Aricia. Persius alludes
to this passage 1. 70 ‘ nec ponere lucum
Artifices’ ; not artistsenoughto describe
agrove ’Conington

17. The smooth and alliterative line,
meant to suit the scene it pictures‚ is
either a quotation or a parody of the
kind of descriptive passages of which
Horace speaks.
