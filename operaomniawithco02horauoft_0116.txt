HORATII SATIRARUM

Quae neque in aede sonent certantia iudice Tarpa,

Nec redeant iterum atque iterum spectanda theatris.
Arguta meretrice potes Davoque Chremeta 40
Eludente senem comis garrire libellos

Unus vivorum, Fundani; Pollio regum

Facta canit pede ter percusso; forte epos acer

Ut nemo Varius ducit ; ,molle atque facetum

Vergilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae. 45

of Cyrene, or as he knew his own Ban-
dusian spring ‘ perlucidior vitro.'

ludo. See on Od. 1. 32. 2.

38. in aede sonent; ‘in aede Mu-
sarum ubi poetae carmina sua recitabant ’
Porph. See Juv. S. 7. 37, of the poet who
recites in a room lent by his patron,
‘ Musarum et Apollinis aede relicta.’
The temple of Apollo Palatinus, which
contained figures of the Muses, was not
opened till B. c. 28 (see introd. to Od. 1.
31). The only known temple of the
Muses before this was the temple ‘ Her-
culis Musarum,’ built by M. Fabius
Nobilior, the friend of Ennius, in B.C.
187, and restored by L. Marcius Philip-
pus, the step—father of Augustus, Burn,
p. 311. Pliny (N. H. 34. 10) tells a
story of Accius the poet having put a
statue, larges than life, of himself ‘in
Camenarum aede‚' which may be a loose
designation os this one, or may refer to
one not otherwise known. In the time of
Livius Andronicus the temple of Minerva
on the Aventine was assigned for meet-
ings of the ‘ collegium poetarum ' (Fest-
s. v. Scribae. Val. Mas 3. 7. ΙΙ). These
may probably have been transferred later
to a temple of the Muses or Camenae.

Tarpa. The critic who presides at
these prize recitations is given by the
Schol. the additional names ⁴ Sp.
Maecius,' which identisy him with the
‘ Maecius ' of A. P. 387, and so with the
critic who is named in Cic. ad Fam. 7. 1
as having been in some way made
responsible for the plays to be performed
in Pompey’s theatre in B. C. 55. We
know nothing of him from other sources.
See on A. P. l. c.

40. arguta. So Epp. 1. 14. 42 ‘calo
argutus,' of the slave whose wits are
sharpened by town life. The names of
Davus the slave, and Chremes the old
man, are those of the Andria of Terence,
though there is no scene which exactly
corresponds with that suggested here.

41 . comis, probably nom. = ‘ comiter,'

‘ so as to please.'

garrire libellos, = to write light
comedies of easy talk. Fundanius is not
mentioned by Quintilian, nor otherwise
known to us. Horace puts the story of
Nasidienus' supper, in Sat. 2. 8, into
his mouth. For ‘ garrire ’ cp. Sat. 2. 6.
7742. Pollio. Od. 2. 1. introd.

regum. Od. 4. 2. 13, the kings os
legend.

43. pede ter percusso =‘ trimetris ¹
A.P. 252‚‘the measure with three beats'3
‘pede‚’ in the same sense as supr. v. 1.
It is also taken (as by Orelli and Dillr.)
literally ‘ to three beats of the foot‚' i. e.
to a metre which is so marked. For
‘ percusso ’ as a technical term see Cic.
de Orat. 3. 47. 182 ‘sunt insignes per-
cussiones eorum numerorum,’ i. e. of
the iambic and trochaic.

forte, ‘ manly.'

acer ut nemo, ‘with a fire all his
own.’

44. ducit. There is no continuous
metaphor. Heindorf and others compare
the use of ‘ deducere ⁷ (Sat. 2. 1. 4, etc.)‚
‘to spin'; but ‘ducere epos,⁷ ‘versus,’
(Ov. Trist. 5. 12. 63), ‘carmen' (ib. 1.
1 1. 18, etc.)‚ are perhaps rather analogous
to the uses of ‘ducere’ of architecture
(Od. 4. 6. 23), of moulding in brass
(Epp. 2. 1. 240), or marble (Virg. Aen.
6. 848). For Varius as the epie poet see
Od. 1. 6. 2 ‘Maeonii carminis alite.'

molle atque facetum, ‘ smoothness
and exquisite finish.’ ‘ Facetum ' is in-
terpreted by Quintilian, 6. 3. 20 ‘ Face—
tum quoquenontantum circum ridiculum
opinor consistere. Neque hine diceret
facetum carminis genus natura con-
cessum esse Vergilio. Deseris hanc
magis et excultae cuiusdam elegantiae
appellationem puto.⁷ virgil had at this
time made public his Eclogues. See
Introd. to the Satires, p. 4.

45. annuerunt, Epod. 9. 17 ‘ verter-
unt‚’ Epp. 1. 4. 7 ‘dederunt’
