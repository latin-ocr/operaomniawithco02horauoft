HORATII SATIRARUM

Angustoque vagos pisces urgere catino.
Magna movet stomacho fastidia, seu puer unctis
Tractavit calicem manibus dum furta ‘ligurrit;

Sive gravis veteri craterae limus adhaesit.

80

Vilibus in scopis, in mappis, in scobe quantus

Consistit sumptus?

Neglectis flagitium ingens.

Ten lapides varios lutulenta radere palma

Et Tyrias dare circum inluta toralia vestes,

Oblitum quanto curam sumptumque minorem 85
Haec habeant, tanto reprehendi iustius illis

Quae nisi divitibus nequeant contingere mensis?’

Docte Cati, per amicitiam divosque rogatus,

Ducere me auditum, perges quocunque, memento.

Nam quamvis memori referas mihi pectore cuncta,
Non tamen interpres tantundem iuveris.

Adde

Voltum habitumque hominis, quem tu vidisse beatus
Non magni pendis, quia contigit3 at mihi cura

77. angusto vagos. The verbal an-
tithesis is to express the incongruity.
To come more closely, it may be doubted
whether ‘vagos' describes the look of
the fish ‘sprawlingj ‘all abroad‚’ on the
dish too small for it, or (as though
he gave a slightly ludicrous reason)
its previous habits, with the sea to roam
in, now cooped up where it could not
lie at length. Cp. the picture in Sat. 2.
S. 42 ‘ squillas inter murena natantes In
patina porrecta.'

79. dum : depends on ‘ unctis,' ⁶ which
has become greasy whilst,' etc. Cp. the
slave in Sat. 1. 3. 80 ‘ patinam qui tollere
iussus Sernesos pisces tepidumque ligur-
rierit ius.'

80,. gravis: prob. as Orelli, ‘offen-
sive.

veteri : like the epithets in vv. 83, 84
‘ varios,' ‘Tyrias,’ to emphasize the in-
consisten0y3 an old and valuable mixing-
bowl ; but left uncleaned.

limus, ‘ dried sediment.'

81. scopis, from ‘scopa,’ ‘ brooms.’

mappis. Here apparently napkins
for the waiters. In Sat. 2. 8. 63 and
Epp. 1. 5. 22 they are for the guests.

scobe. Mayor on Juv. Sat. 14. 67
shows that the sawdust <sometimes
coloured and perfumed, sometimes of
precious material) was strewn on the

floor and remained there during the
feast.

quantus, ‘how great is it'? i.e. ‘is
it a large one Ῥ

82. neglectis, abl. absoL, supply ‘ests

83. ten . . . radere. See on Sat. 1.9.
72 ‘ hunccine solem Tam nigrum surrexe
mihi'? 2. 8. 66.

lapides varios, the tessellated pave-
ment.

palma, a broom of palm-leaves.

84. inluta toralia: Epp. 1. 5. 22
‘ne turpe toral ne sordida mappa Cor-
ruget nares.' ‘ 'foralia ’ are of some
washing material thrown over or round
the permanent covers of richer stuff.

For vestes, of the covers of couches,
see Sat. 2. 3. 118, 2. 6. 103, 106.

86. reprehendi, ‘they are complain-
ed of’; a short way of saying ‘every
carelessness about them is complained
of.'

88-95. Horace returns to the mystery
of v. 11, ‘who can the great teacher
be? The best reporter will not make
up sor him. I must see him and learn
the secrets of a happy lise.⁷

89. perges quoeunque, ‘ whither-
soever it be that you will go,’ i. e. to
hear some more such lectures.

91. interpres, ‘ being only a re-
porter.’
