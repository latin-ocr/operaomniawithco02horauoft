Rector Thebarum, quid me perferre patique
Indignum coges?’ ‘Adimam bona.’ ‘Nempe pecus, rem, 75

Lectos, argentum: tollas licet?

Compedibus saevo te sub custode tenebo.’

Hoc sentit, ‘ Moriar.'

have at last the serious answer to the
question ofv. 40; but it grows out of a
direct comparison with the picture last
given of the pretender to goodness with
his real heart in riches as a slave. ‘ The
true “ vir bonus ” is the man independ-
ent of favour or dissavour—of wealth or
poverty—able to command srecdom
even in a prison.' With the spirit of
the description cp. Od. 3. 3. 1-8.

This is thrown into the form of a
paraphrase of the (lialogue between
Dionysus and Pentheus in Euripides,
Bacch. 492 foll.

ΔΙ. εἴφ’ ὅτι παθεΐν 6⁶?- τί με τὸ δεινὸν
ἐργάσει;
ΠΕ. πρῶτον μὲν ἁβρὸν βόστρυχον τεμῶ

ΔΙ. ἱερὸς ὁ πλόκαμος· τῷ θεῷ δ’ αὐτὸν

ΔΙ. αὐτός μ’ ἀφαιροῦ· τόνδε Διονύσου

The feeling of the god's replies is well
kept in Horace’s lines, but there is much
freedom in the reproduetion, especially in
the substitution sor the ‘lock of hair'
and the ⁴ thyrsus ’ of the luxuries which
the Roman man of wealth values, the
closing of the dialogue with the answer
of Dionysus, that he can have his release
at will, and the turn which Horace gives
to this answer (see note on v. 78). We
notice here, as in Epp. 1. 2, how Horace
read the Greek poets with the inclina-

tion to give allegorical and moral ap-
plications to their legends.

74. rector Thebarum: an addition
to the Greek. The feeling is ‘ for all
your greatnessf Cp. in Od. 3. 3. 3 (the
passage cited as parallel in general sense
to this) ‘voltus instantis tyranni.’

For perferre patique cp. Epp. 1. 15.

75. nempe, ‘to wit,' ‘I understand,'
introducing an ironical complction of
the interlocutor's sentence. Cp. Sat. 2.

76. lectos z couches of costly material
and make. In Juvenal's time they were
made os tortoise-shell (Juv. S. 11. 94)
and precious metals.

4. 28 n.

78. opinor. Cp. ‘cred0,' in an in-
terpretation,‘ Sat. 2. 2. 90. Horace has
stopped the dialogue at the place that
suits him, and the interpretation which
he puts on the words is also arbitrary,
and one which could hardly suit the
actual speeches. Dionysus’ freedom is
recovered in the play by his exercise of
divine power.

79. mors ultima linea rerum est.
Horace's comment (not Dionysus').

racecourse, to which lise is constantly
compared. Cp. Cic. Tusc. D. 1. 18. 15

decursum nihil sit praeterea pertimes-
cendum,' also the use of ’γραμμὴ κακῶν
Eur. Fr. 174, βίου id. Electr. 945.
Notice how the Stoic teaching as to
suicide is here sanctioned.
