386 INTRODUCTION TO THE ARS POETICA.

possible that they may have been due to direct imitation, but on the
one hand Horace’s poem is an Epistle, with the links of thought, the
proportion of topics, the personal purpose, which belong to an
Epistle, on the other hand we may be sure that in criticism, as
in philosophy, he put himself into the hands of no single master,
‘nullius addictus iurare in verba.' His eye throughout is primarily
on Roman poetry, not on Greek. He has his own purpose, which
could not be Neoptolemus's, and everything contributes to that. He
is bringing to bear on a literary question the same shrewd judgment
and the same standing principles which he has applied in other
poems to moral questions. A large part of Michaelis' treatise is
taken up with disproving propositions which would now scarcely be
advanced, as that the Epistle was built upon Plato's Phaedrus or
Aristotle's Poetics. The same general answer holds towards these
as is made to Porphyrion’s statement about Neoptolemus, with the
additional weight given by the fact that in these cases we have the
works which he is said to have taken as his guides, and can measure
exactly his debt to them. But some debt there is. The figure with
which the poem opens is most probably due to a remembrance of
Plat. Phaedr., and the parallelisms, both in thought and expression,
between Horace and the Poetics, though they are always accom-
panied by divergences which show that he is writing independently,
are yet probably too close not to imply some memory of the text of
Aristotle ¹. In one passage (vv. 161-174') we seem to find-not
slavish imitation, but full remembrance of some Chapters in the
Rhetoric.

¹ See especially the notes on vv. 81, 82, 128, 144, 148, 191-193, 195.
