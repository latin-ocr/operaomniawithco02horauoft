Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina; verum
Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur, et ultro,
Si taceas, laudant quicquid scripsere beati.

At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema,

Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti;

110

Audebit, quaecunque parum splendoris habebunt
Et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna feruntur,
Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant

Et versentur adhuc† intra penetralia Vestae.

105. impune: best taken with legen-
tibus. ‘ Let me now close my open ears
and allow them to read without sear of
reprisals.⁷ Cp. Epp. 1. 19. 40 ‘auditor
et ultor,' Juv. S. 1. 3 ‘impune ergo mihi
recitaverit ille togatas? '

106 foll. The poetaster is laughed at,
but he enjoys his own work and thinks it
admirable. The man who aims at true
poetica] work is of different stuff, and he
has a serious task before him.

108. si taceas: Madv. ξ 348 ; cp.
Epp. 1. 16. 5. It is not the proper protasis
to ‘ laudant ' but to a suppressed ⁶ laud-
ent’ which may be mentally supplied
with ‘ulti-0? ‘They habitually praise
[and would praise] on their own ac-
count if you should hold your tongue.’

beati, with laudant, but kept till
last to gain more point, ‘ happy people ! ’
With the picture cp. Catull. 22. 14
‘Idem [Suffenus] infaceto est infacetior
rure, Simul poemata attigit, neque idem
unquam Aeque est beatus ac poema
cum scribit : Tam gaudet in se tamque
se ipse miratur.'

109. legitimum: true to the laws of
art. Cp. A. P. 274 ‘legitimum sonum.'

fecisse : for the tense see Od. 5. 4. 51 ;
the desire is not to compos-e but to have
composed, to leave behind you a poeni.

1 10. cum tabulis, ‘ with his writing
tablets,' i. e. for the purpose of composi-
tion.

censoris honesti : the special function
of the Censor which Horace has in view
is that of revising the lists of the Senate
and the equites with the purpose of
striking out unworthy 1110111 bers ; a func-
11011 which Augustus (Suet. Aug. 36) had
revived. The idea is carried out in
many of the phrases that follow⁷ e. g.
⁶ splendoris‚' ‘ honore indigna) ‘movere
loco‚' ‘invita recedant! The true poet
will be as caresul in admitting a word to

a place in 1115 writings as a conscientions
censor in admitting a claim to the senate.
Dr. Johnson, as is well known, happily
transfers these lines, in his quotation of
them on the title page of his dictionary‚
srom the poet maintaining the purity of
his own diction to the lexicographer
doing the same for a language.

111. splendoris: frequently used by
Cicero of the ‘ lustre’ belonging to the
senatorian or equestrian order or their
menibers.

112. sine pondere ; A. P. 320.

feruntur. 1 follow Ritter and Munro
in giving the reading of the best MSS.
instead of ‘ ferentur‚⁷ which has been
more generally adopted. Keller prints
⁶ feruntur‚' but considers it a mistake ot*
the archetype; but a mistake is more
likely to have been made the other way.
Ifwe accept it there is a purposed change
oftime ; ‘ habebunt’ and ‘ erunt ⁷ describe
the future results which the censor fore-
sees, ‘they will, if left there⁷ seem dull or
unimpressive by and bye’: ‘feruntur’
describes a present fact, ⁴ or are [now]
considered unworthy of the dignity.'
The censor would in his decision give
some Weight to current popular opinion.

1 13. movere loeo : a technical term.
Liv. 39. 42 ‘ senatorio loco movit.' Cp.
Sat. 1. 6. 20 ⁴ Censorque moveret Appius'

invita recedant: from their place in
the poem.

114. versentur intra penetralia
Vestae. The editors generally give
‘ intra,’ but this is a conjecture, all the
MSS. having ‘ inter,’ which does not
seem an impossible expression. Keller,
who retains it, explains ⁴ penetralia ’ as
=‘sacra penetralia‚' the emblems and
relies preserved in the shrine. The
phrase as a whole is a difficult one.
Porph. explains it by ‘ d01ni‚’ ‘ licat in
animo nostro ve1·sentur‚’ 111 the poet’s
