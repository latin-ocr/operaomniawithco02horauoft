EPISTLE V.

TO TORQUATUS.

SEE introduction to Od. 4. 7.
An invitation to a modest entertainment at the poet’s house on the night before
Caesar's birthday. The tone and topics are very like those of the Odes.

If you do not mind a simple entertainment, Torquatus, I shall expect you at
sunset. 1 will get you what wine Ι can: if that is not to your liking, you must
send better. All is ready and in best trim in your honour. Leave money-making
and ambition. To-morrow is a holiday‚ so we can sit all night if we like. The
only use of fortune is to enjoy it. I am in the humour for merriment. Wine is
nature’s best gift. My business is to see that all is neat and clean, and that the
company is well chosen. Ι shall have Butra and Septimius and, Ι hope, Sabinus.
There is room for you to bring some guests, but remember the drawbacks of too
large a party. Your business is to say how many you wish them to be, and then

to slip away from your business and come.

SI potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis,
Nec modica cenare times olus omne patella,
Supremo te sole dorni, Torquate, manebo.

from ‘ Pausias ’ Sat. 2. 7. 95. As
another instance of furniture osa special
make being known by the maker’s name
is quoted Aul. Gell. 12. 2 ‘ Soterici

in great houses ‘ rubro ubi cocco Tincta

maker, and the tone implies that he is
modestly proud of them. Some MSS.
had ‘Archaicis,' which has been taken
as a Latin form of ἀρχαϊκοῖς, but such a
use of a Greek word is not Horatian, and
in all words of similar form (as ‘ Achai·
cus’ Od. 4. 3. 5ἱ the antepenultimate ‘ a ’
is long as in the Greek. The Comm.
Cruq. who read ‘ Archaicis‚‘ explained it
ofthe name of the maker.

2. modica. Cp. Od. 1. 20. 1 ‘Vile
potabis modicis Sabinum Cantharis.’ In

both places he is matching some modesty
in the cups or dishes with the modesty
of their contents. Is it of make and
material? or of size? For the latter

We need not suppose that the supper
consisted entirely of this.

say, ‘ bottled,' transferred from the

only done with the better wines which
