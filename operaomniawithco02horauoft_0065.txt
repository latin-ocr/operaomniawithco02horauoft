 

LIB. I.

SAT. 4. 53

Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior atque os

Magna sonaturum‚ des nominis huius honorem.

Idcirco quidam comoedia necne poema 45
Esset quaesivere, quod acer spiritus ac vis ’

Nec verbis nec rebus inest, nisi quod pede certo

Differt sermoni, sermo merus.

‘ At pater ardens

Saevit, quod meretrice nepos insanus amica
Filius uxorem grandi cum dote recuset, 50
Ebrius et, magnum quod dedecus, ambulet ante

Noctem cum facibus?

Numquid Pomponius istis

Audiret leviora, pater si viveret? Ergo
Non satis est puris versum perscribere verbis,
Quem si dissolvas, quivis stomachetur eodem 55

43. ingenium. The native gift: cp.
its contrast with ‘ ars ’ A. P. 295. What
particular gift, must be settled by the
context, but it is specially used sor the
gift of the poet—imagination, fancy;
ep. A. P. 323 ‘Grais ingenium Grais
dedit ore rotundo Musa loqui.' Horace
claims it for himself, Od. 2. 18. 9.

mens divinior, ‘inspirati0n‚' as
something which raises him above the
ordinary condition of human intelli-
gence. The poet is ‘divino quodam
spiritu inflatus ’ Cic. Arch. 8. 18. One
who has this inspirationis said ‘ spirare ;’
see the expression of v. 46 and note 011
Od. 2. 16. 38 ; cp. also Od. 4. 6. 29.

os magna sonaturum, i.e. a corres-

pondent diction; cp. Virg. G. 3. 294·

‘magno nunc ore sonandum.’ For the use
of‘os' cp. Od. 4. 2. 8, A. P. 94, 323·

45. quidam,the ‘ nonnulli ’ of Cicero,
l. c. Heind. points out that the reason
given applies to the new comedy of
manners. Menander and his Latin imita-
tors, not to the old Attie comedy.

46. acer spiritus, fire of inspiration.

247. rebus : a wide word for the matter
as opposed to the diction, including
Aristotle's διάνοια, ‘sententia,’ ‘ thought,’
as well as μῦθος, ‘ fabula,⁷ ‘ plot;' cp.
A. P. 89 ‘ res comica,' 32 2 ‘ versus inopes
rerum) Cp. with Orell. Quintil. 10. 1.
27 ‘ ab his [poetis] et in rebus spiritus, et
in verbis sublimitas . . . petitur.'

pede certo, i. e. laws of rhythm,
fixed suceession of quantities. So ‘ tem-
pora certa ' v. 58.

48. at, etc„ an interruption, answered

in v. 52. ‘ Surely there is fire in the
scenes where a father storms at his son,’
etc. The cases imagined are common-
places of Latin comedy.

49. meretrice, for the relation of the
ablative cp. Od. 3. 5. 6 ‘turpis mari—
tus coniuge barbara.’ nepos, Epod.
1. 34.

51. Persius seems to have this among
other passages in view, 5. 163 ‘ an siccis
dedecus obstem Cognatis? an rem
patriam rumore sinistro . . . frangam,
dum Chrysidis udas Ebrius ante fores
exstincta cum face canto? ' So that the
‘ faces ' would be the ‘ funalia ’ of Od. 3.
26. 7, and the picture os a tipsy serenade.

52. Horace answers, ‘ After all, this is
only the language of passion in real
life ε for poetry we want not metre only
but poetica] diction; no one would mis<
take Ennius for prose even if you de-
stroyed the metre.'

52. Pomponius ⁴ may be a real
person whose circumstances would be
known to the readers. Or he may be
the person in comedy alluded to ; ‘ pater
si viveret ' in that case meaning ‘if it
were a father in real life‚’ opp. ‘perso—
natus pater‘ v. 56.

54. puris, ‘ plain,’ ‘unadomed3' see
Bentley on A. P. 99. Quintilian, 8. 3.
14, reeommends, as the suitable style for
cases heard in private or before a small
bench, ‘ purus sermo et dissimilis curae.'
Cp. the use os ⁵ purum ' with ‘ argentum.'
‘ not chased.' It translates ψιλός Arist.
Poet. 1. 7.
