LIB. Ι. EPIST. 16. 287

EPISTLE XVI.

TO QUINTIUS.

Vei-ses 1—16. VOU ask about the produce of my farm, but seem hardly to under-
stand its nature. It is in the heart of the hills, but for such a situation it has
all possible advantages—a sunny aspect, good climate, surprising richness os
woodland fruit, and foliage, fresh water.

It is to me a paradise of beauty and safety even in September.

17—24. And now of yourself. I hope you too have found the secret of life.
We are all congratulating you on your good fortune—and rightly; provided
you are taking your measure of your happiness not from our words, but
from your own feelings and from philosophy.

True happiness belongs only to the wise and good. Are you that?

25—51. If the world tells you so, do not believe it at once, any more than you
would if it told you that you were a second Augustus.

31—40. No doubt all feel pleasure in being called good and wise.

But we must remember that those who give titles can take them away. Are
we to feel pain when they destroy our character? Such pleasure and such pain
are alike proofs that we are not yet good and wise.

40. For what, to go back, do you mean by a ‘ good man ' ⁸?

41—43. The stock answer is ‘ the man of respectability, who breaks no law, whose
word is a bond, whose testimony is trusted.’

44, 45. Nay, that is ontside only. He may be a villain underneath.

46—49. Negatives do not constitute goodness, even in a slave.

The truly good man is good from love of virtue.

50-56. True goodness implies motive as well as act. The pretender to goodness
is often kept straight by sear of punishment.

57e62. But his true desire is not to be good but to seem good, in order that he
may the better gratify his love of gain.

63u68. There is the true motive, and that makes the man who feels it a slave.

69-72. You may make a usesul shepherd of him, or ploughman, ortiader, but not
a philosopher.

73-79. The truly wise and good man is like Dionysus in the play. He fears no
one, wants nothing, can never lose his liberty, for he has in his own hands
the key of liberty.

It is characteristic of Horace's irony that an Epistle in which, more than in most,
he assumes the tone of a Stoic and mounts the professor's pulpit, follows one in
which he has described himself as a second Maenius.

Who Quintius was, and to what extent he was meant to take home the lecture,
we cannot tell. It may be the ‘ Quintius Hirpinus,’ to whom Horace addresses
counsels in a very different vein in Od. 2. 11. It is to be said however that the
total ignorance which is presumed in him of the poet's country house does not
point to a friend of long standing, and that the tone of v. 17 foll , isit does not
require, certainly suits well with, a friend young in years towards whom congratu-
lations on some early success may not unbecomingly be followed up, by an elder,
with some good advice. We need not imitate some editors in drawing out in
