HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ploravere suis non respondere favorem

Speratum meritis.

Diram qui contudit hydram ιο

Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,

Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari.

Urit enim fulgore suo, qui praegravat artes

Infra se positas; exstinctus amabitur idem.

Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores, 15
Iurandasque tuum per numen ponimus aras,

Nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes.

Sed tuus hic populus, sapiens et iustus in uno

repeating all these forms of beneficent
labour, encouraging agriculture, civi—

lizing, restoring peace, settling veteran
soldiers on confiscated farmlands, found-
ing cities3 cp. the recital of the effects of
his rule in Od. 4. 5. 17-32‚ 4. 15. 4-20,
and with this particular phrase cp. Od.

10. contudit, with his club. For
the favourite comparison of Augustus to
Hercules see on Od. 3 9, 3.14. 1,
4. 5. 36, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6 802.

11. fatali. It elevates Hercules’
labours, and by implication those of
Augustus, to describe them as not acci-
dental but part of the predestined order
of things

portenta,
1 .

312. supremo fine: not by any fresh
labour but by the end which admits
nothing aster it. Cp. ‘ morte suprema’
Epp. 2. 2. 173 aud Ov. Met. 3. 136
‘ dicique beatus Ante obitum nemo
supremaque funera debet.’ With the
thought cp. Od. 3. 24. 30—32. ⁴ Invidia‚’
in the case of Hercules, was the envy of
Juno, which according to the legend was
appeased by his death.

domari : the verb is chosen in order
to suggest the image of envy as the last
and greatest monster with which he
grappled.

13. praegravat: Sat. 2. 2. 78. As
‘ urit ’ gains its force by suggesting the
contrast of what should be, ‘ scorches,’
instead of warming or fighting, so ‘ prae-
gravat ’ implies an opp. ‘ tollit,' ‘weighs
down‚' ‘ depresses ' instead of lifting.

Od. 1. 22.

‘ monsters ' :

artes: see note on Od.4.15.12
It is chosen as a very general word,
covering art (proper) and the‘ arts’ of
lise; excellence' ln any department

14. exstinctus: the metaphor of ‘ful-

gore' is resumed. ‘These suns of glory
please not till they set.⁷ Pope.

15. praesentif while still among us)

maturos, ‘betimesss not waiting, as
with the heroes, till you are gone.

16. iurandaS. ‘Iuro' is used both with
an acc. ‘ numen ⁹ Virg. Aen. 6 324,

a‘ras '.Juv S 3. 144 (whence the passive
‘dis iuranda palus' Ov. Met. 2. 46), and
with‘ per,' ‘per caput hoc iuro 'Virg.
Aen. 9. 300. Horace here combines the
two constructions.

numen. The question is doubtful
between ‘ numen,' the reading of V and
of two MSS. to the concurrent testimony
of which Keller attaches high value,viz.
E (Munichl and R (Vatican)‚ and
‘nomen‚' which is found in the great
majority of MSS. ‘ Numen ’ was re-
stored to the text by Bentley, who quotes
abundantly to show that ‘iurare numen ’
or ‘ per numen ⁷ is the usual phrase, and
points out that Ovid speaks repeatedly
of ‘ Augustum numen,' ‘ Caesareum
numen,’ etc. It has been accepted by
Keller (in his Epilegornena])‚ by Ritter‚
and by Munro. Orelli. Dillr„ and
Schiitz prefer ‘nomen.y The historical
reference is probably to the worship of
the ‘ genius Augusti ⁷ among the Lares.
Cp. Od. 4. 5. 34 ‘et Laribus tunm
Miscet numen,’ and see general introd.
to this Epistle, p. 328.

18. tuus hic populus, ‘this same
people of thine.' ‘ Tuus ' at once sums
up the attitude of the people which is
in question, ‘this people so devoted to
you though you are still with us,' and
gives a point of connection between the
address to Augustus and the arraign-
ment of the poet's contemporaries. Au-
gustus is in a sense responsible for them
and should hear their failings.
