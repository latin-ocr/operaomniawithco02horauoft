polentam vinum murrhinam.' Opponents
notice that ‘decernit' is a phrase which
suits those who quote verses as well as
those who compose them, and that
Nonius quotes the Acharistio as a play
of Plautus. (2) Seneca's ‘inscriptus
Dossenni monumento titulus: Hospes
resiste et sophiam Dossenni lege' Epist.
89, which carries us a very little way, as
the only question being discussed is
whether ‘sophia' was a word used in
earlier Latin. Dossennus (or ‘Dorsen-
nus’) was certainly a Roman cognomen,
being found on coins of the ‘gens Ru-
bria.' It probably meant ‘ humpbacked.'
Meanwhile it has been conjectured with
some plausibility that the word, which
is found in two fragments of Atellanae
by Pomponius Bononiensis, and in
Festus s. v. ‘temetum’ (‘Novius in
duobus Dossennis,’ i. e. ‘Novius, the
writer of Atellanae, in his play, the two
Dossenni ’), and restored with more or
less probability in several other places,
was, like Bucco, Maccus, etc., the name
of a standing character in the Atellanae.
This explanation is adopted by Ritter‚
Dill‘„ and wilkins. Horace then will
be speaking throughout of Plautus, ‘how
thoroughly in his greedy parasites he
reproduces the “Dossennus ’⁷ of {arces
If we accept Miiller's emendation in
Varr. de ling. Lat. 7. 95 ‘manducari a
quo in Atellanis Dossennum (MSS. ad
obsenuw vocant manducum‚' the Dos—

* senstis would be the glutton; but it is

not certain, and from the word itself
we should rather guess that it belonged
to the personal deformity which was
traditional in the character, and gave no
clue to the character itself.

174. non adstricto socco: cp. Sat.
1. 3. 31 ‘male laxus calceus'; here of
the ‘sock' or slipper which was to
comedy what the ‘cothurnus’ was to
tragedy, A. P. 80, 903 in ‘slipshod’
style.

percurrat adds ‘hasty'3 cp. ‘pro-
perare ' v. 58.

175. nummum : the sing. is con—
temptuous; ‘he is in such a hurry to
drop a coin into his purse that he does
not stay to finish his work.'

loculos: see on Sat. 1. 3. 17.

176. securus: for the constr. see on
Sat. 2. 4. 50.

cadat an stet t see on v. 79. ‘ Stare’
is used frequently of a play succoeding,
as Ter. Phorm. prol. 9 ‘ quum stetit olim
nova Actoris opera magis stetisse quam
sua.' ‘ Cadat' recalls the Greek ἐκπίπ-
τειν. Cicero puts the two together, but
with a more distinct reference to wrest-
lers, Orat. 28. 98, of an orator, ‘ mini-
meque in lubrico versabitur et si semel
eonstiterit nunquam cadet.'

recto talo : perhaps from the Greek
as Pind. Isthm. 6. 12 ὀρθῷ ἔστασας ε’πῖ
σφύρῳ, or by Pers. S. 5. 104 ⁴ recto vivere
talo.' On the charge against Plautus of
writing sor money see Sellar, Poets of
the Republic, p. 164.

177 soll. Plautus has too little thought
of the spectators‚ others have too much.

177. ventoso gloria curru. The
power of glory to carry men away is
touched in a still stronger metaphor in
Sat. 1. 6. 23 ‘trahit constrictos gloria
curru.’ ‘ Ventoso ⁷—a figure within the
figure; the ehaiiot of glory is ‘ windy,'
because glory itself is as unsubstantial
and as variable as the wind. ‘ Ventosa
feret cui gloria fraudem ’ Virg. Aen. 1 1.
708.

178. lentus, ‘languid.’

sedulus, ‘ attentive.'

179. laudis avarum: A. P. 324-
Note the link in this phrase to the last
paragraph. It matches the φιλότιμος
against the φιλοχρήματος.

180. valeat res ludicra, i. e. ‘that
is a reason for not writing sor the stage.'

181. reducit: Od. 4. 2. 17 ‘ Quos
Elea domum reducit Palma caelestes.'
