EPIST. 19.

Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor
Impensis cenarum et tritae munere vestis3
Non ego, nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor,

Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor:
‘Spissis indigna theatris

Hinc illae lacrimae.

40

Scripta pudet recitare et nugis addere pondus,’

Si dixi :

‘Rides‚’ ait, ‘et Iovis auribus ista

Servas; fidis enim manare poetica mella

³

Te solum, tibi pulcher.

Ad haec ego naribus uti 45

FormidO, et luctantis acuto ne secer ungui,
‘Displicet iste locus,’ clamo, et diludia posco.

37. ventosae: Epp. 1. 8. 12. With
the picture cp. Epp. 2. 2. 103, A. P.
420 soll.; and Persius' imitation 1. 53
foll. ‘calidum scis ponere sumen, Scis
comitem horridulum trita donare la-
cema,’ etc.

39. auditor et ultor, ‘ who listen to
them and give them as good again.' It
is said jestingly‚ as Bentley points out.
His account in Sat. 1. 4. 73 is ‘Non re-
cito cuiquam nisi amieis, idque coactus)
These words are the original of Ju—
venal’s opening burst, ‘ Semper ego au-
ditor tantum. nunquamne reponam?'
Cp. also Epp. 2. 2. 105 ‘impune legen-
tibus! The ‘nobiles scriptores’ are his
literary friends—Virgil, Varius, etc.

40. ‘To canvass the schoolmasters'
lecture platsorms,⁷ i.e. to pay court to
those who expound and criticize poetry
and can make or mar the fortunes of
a young poet.

tribus: not, as some take it, the
pupils, but part of the metaphor of
ambire; ‘to canvass the schoolmasters
as a candidate would the tribes.‘ So
et, pulpita adds no fresh object but
indicates what was sought of the ‘ gram-
matici.'

41. hinc illae lacrimae, ‘there is
the true grievance.' A proverbial ex-
pression, even where no tears are in-
volved3 Cic. pro Cael. 25. 61. It comes
from Terence, Andr. 1. 1. 126.

spissis theatris: cp. ‘spissa sedilia’
A. P. 205. Tacitus de Orat. 13 speaks
of Virgil as reciting in a theatre. See
Mayor's exhaustive note on Recitation
Juv. S. 3. 9. It may be doubted whether
theatres proper are intended, or lecture
hails, the reciters' ‘ show-places.'

VOL. ΙΙ.

43. Iovis auribus: i..e ‘Augustiff
Cp. Sat. 2. 6. 52 ‘deos quoniam propius
contingisss where the tone of jealousy is
the same.

44. manare mella. The accus. as
‘ stillare rorem ⁵ A. P. 429.

45. ad. haee : see on Epod. 9. 17.

naribus uti: interpreted by Pers. 1.
40, where he is imitating the passage
‘ nimis uncis Naribus indulges, ‘ · that is,
‘you are too visibly sneering at us'
εΙ do not dare to show my resentment
too openly)

46. acuto ungui: cp p. Od. 1.6. 18.
It implies the ferocity of the attack.
Cp. Cic. Tusc. 5. 27. 77 ‘adolescentium
greges Lacedaemone vidimus lpsi incre-
dibili contentione certantes pugnis, cal-
cibus, unguibus, morsu denique, cum
exanimarentur prius quam victos se fa-
terentur.’

47. iste locus. Orelli and others
take this literally (aster the Scholiasts)‚
as the place proposed sor recitation, ‘I
make it seem aquestion ofplace and time,
not an absolute refusal,’ but it is better
to take it as part of the metaphor of the
combatants in the arena. The combat-
ant objects to the place or asks sor a
postponement. Possibly ‘ locus ‘ had some
closer technical sense as applied to such
contests. Cp. Aesch. in Ct. ξ 207 ἐν τοῖς
’γυμνικοῖς ἀγῶσιν ὁρᾶτε τοὺς πύκτας περι
τῆς στάσεως ἀλλήλους διαγωνιζομένους.
The whole line will mean, ‘I put the
whole question by; I will not quarrel
over it!

diludia: not found elsewhere. Porph.
explains by ‘intermissionem vel dila-
tionem ludorum?
