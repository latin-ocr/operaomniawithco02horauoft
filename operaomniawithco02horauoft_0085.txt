10. nullis maioribus: none that
could be named, none who had ‘im-
agines; ’ so Livy l. c. ‘ patre nullo.'

11. et, with probos, vixisse being
common to both clauses.

12. contra. The constr. is con-
tinued srom ‘ persuades hoc tibi vere.’

Laevinum. ‘ Hic P. Valerius [Lae-
vinus] adeo foedis et proiectis in omnem
turpitudinem moribus vixit ut provehi
non potuerit ultra quaestoriam digni-
tatem ' Porph. One Valerius Laevinus
was distinguished in the war with
Pyrrhus, another in the second Punic
war, and a third triumphed over the
Ligurians in B.C. 175. We are clearly
to think here of a man of high lineage
who on grounds of personal demerit
failed to gain an election.

Valeri, sc. of P. Valerius Publicola the
colleague of Brutus.

genus, of a single descendant, as
‘Iapeti genus,' Od. 1. 3. 27, ‘iuvenis
...ab alto demissum genus Aenea’
Sat. 2. 5. 63.

unde, for ‘a quo‚' cp. esp. Od. 2.
12.7‚ and see on Od. 1. 7. 7 and 1. 12. 17.
But this is the instance of its use most
nearly of agency‚ sor ‘a quo' rather
than ‘ ex quo.'

superbus: an epithet, not merely a
distinguishing ‘ cognomen.⁷ The ‘ pride’
of Tarquin heightens the historic same
of the house which took a leading part
in expelling him.

13. pulsus fugit. The reading of V,
though there is in one or two good MSS.
the variant ⁴ fuit) Madvig discusses the
tense in his Opuscula Academica, ii.
p. 224. After showing that ‘pulsus
suit ’ is an inapplicable form here (mean-
ing as it does ‘he has been, and at
present is in the condition ofhaving been,
banished,'-—sor the simple passive aorist
we require ‘ pulsus est ')‚ he explains this
as parallel with Virgil’s use ofthe present
in relative clauses where the leading verb
is in a past tense, as Aen. 2. 275, 9. 266,
361, 11. 172. Cp. Sat. 1. 2. 56, 2. 3.
61, and see Persius' imitation 4. 2

‘ barbatum hoc crede magistrum Dicere,
sorbitio tollit quem dira cicutae' with
Conington's note.

unius assis . . . licuisse, ⁴ was never
estimated at more than the value of a
single as.’ Cp. Catuli. 5. 2 ‘ Rumores. ..
Omnes unius aestimemus assis.⁷ ‘Pretio '
has also been taken as the abl. of
measure, ⁶ was never estimated (on that
account> at more by the value of a
single as.’ But the point is the abso-
lutely low value set on him. Horace
does not mean to say that birth went
for nothing with the people ;—otherwise
it would contradict V. 9 ;—but that no
birth would make up for worthlessness
even in the eyes of the worst judges.
The expression may be compared with
Arist. Equ. 945 τοῖσι πολλοῖς τούβολοῦ,
‘the many for an obol,’ i. e. the worth-
less crowd.

14. notante iudice ε there is no strict
relation between the technical meaning
of the two words. The people’s adverse
judgment involves disgrace as the mark
of the Censor would. ‘ Notare’ is a
verb which Horace is fond of using in
metaphors; see on Sat. Ι, 3. 24.

15. iudice quo nosti. This con-
struction was helped very probably by a
flavour Qf resemblance to the Greek
attraction of the relative, but it may be
doubted whether there is any real attrac-
tion. The instances quoted are all of
one kind, and involving an ellipsis
which it is at least possible so to
supply as to account for the ease apart
from any attraction. In this case it is
not (as Mr. Yonge points out) the
equivalent of ‘quem nosti'; ‘quo’ is
rather the indirect interrogative, there
being substituted sor a defining epithet
of ‘iudice ⁵ the compound clause ¹ quo,
nosti ' zo‘t'qJ οἶσθα, ‘ ajudge, of what kind,
you know.’ Cp. Sall. Jug. 104 ‘con-
fecto quo intenderat negotio redit' ;
where we may supply the ellipsis as
well by writing ‘quo confecto redire
intenderat’ as ‘quod conficere inten-
derat’3 Liv. 1. 29 ‘quibus quisque
