Nam Venusinus arat finem sub utrumque colonus, 35
Missus ad hoc, pulsis, vetus est ut fama Sabellis,

Quo ne per vacuum Romano incurreret hostis,

Sive quod Apula gens seu quod Lucania bellum

Incuteret violenta.

Sed hic stilus haud petet ultro

Quemquam animantem et me veluti custodiet ensis 40
Vagina tectus; quem cur distringere coner

Tutus ab infestis latronibus? O pater et rex

Iuppiter, ut pereat positum rubigine telum,

Nec quisquam noceat cupido mihi pacis!

At ille

Qui me commorit, (melius non tangere, clamo) 45

parable os the literary position of their
great son: ‘He is a true border man,
of fighting stock, ready to do battle to
any one who assails the territory he has
to guard, from whatever side he eomes3
but (he goes on in v. 39) like them it is a
defensive post he holds, not an offensive
one?

36. missus ad hoc. The foundation
of a colony at Venusia in the third
Samnite war, Β. C. 291, is mentioned by
Velleius 1. 14, and in a fragment of
Dion. Halic.

ad hoo . . . quo ne. The use of‘quo ne '
as simply equivalent to ‘ ne ' or ‘ ut ne ’
belongs acc. to Drager (Hist. Syntax, 2.
p. 689) to later Latin. There are, how-
ever, as he points out, instances where
‘quo ’ has both a final sense and a de-
finite relative sense ; as Liv. 34. 6 ⁶ cau-
tum erat quo ne plus auri et argenti
facti, quo ne plus signati auri et aeris
dorni haberemus‚‘ where ‘.quo‘ is the
comp. abl. aster ‘plus,' having also the
final force of the clause following ‘'cau-
tum erat,' ‘ we had been warned of a sum
beyond which we must not,’ etc. Dr‘ager
thinks that in this place ‘ ad hoc’ gives
‘quo’ this double force (‘ad hoc' is
followed by a final ‘ qui ' in Sat. 2. 6.
42, 2. 8. 255, and compares Ter. Andr.
2. 1. 34 ‘efficite qui (=quomodo) detur
tibi: ego id agam mihi qui ne detur.'
Prof. G. G. Ramsay (Selections of Tib.
and Propert. p. 306) points out that if
‘ quo ’ can be used, ‘ quo ne ' is the na-
tural negative, ‘ne' being substituted
for ‘ non ⁷ aster final particles, as always
after ‘ ut,' and as after ‘ dum ’ in Sat. 1.
1. 40 ‘dum ne te sit ditior alter.' Mr.
Prickard suggests that ‘ quo ne’ had a
legal flavour (the earliest quotation that
Bentley could find for its wider use is the

Digest 21. 1. 17) as though Horace were
professing (in play as towards Trebatius)
to quote some deed of foundation of the
colony. Compare the play in Sat. Ι.
8. 13. Other ways of taking the words,
all very forced, have been suggested
by those who doubt the construction.
Schiitz takes ⁴ quo ⁷ as=‘ ut e0,’ ‘that in
that directions etc. Prof. Palmer joins
‘quo vacuun]‚⁷ ‘than if unguarded by
him,' etc. K. and H. print ‘Quo2 Ne‚’
etc„ sc. ‘ to what purpose? lest‚' etc.

Sabellis. Horace uses this name for
the country folk of his native district,
Sat. 1. 9. 29.

37. Romano, the sing. for the plur.‚
as in Epod. 7. 6 and 7. It may also be
taken,with Bentley, for ‘ agro Romano.’

38. quod=‘ aliquod.'

39. incuteret, a favourite word with
Horace, who extends its meaning ‘ quid
negoti' inf. V. 81, ‘pudorem’ Epp. 1.
18. 77, ‘desiderium‘ Epp. 1. 14. 22.

sed hic stilus z the bearing is pointed
out on v. 34. The play is helped by
the remembrance of the two uses of
the ‘stiluS,' as a pen and a weapon.
Cp. Cic. Phil. 2. 14. 34 ⁶ si meus
stilus ille fuisset, ut dicitur, non solum
unum actum sed totam fabulam con-
fecisset.'

42. tutus, ‘so long as I am safe.'

43. ut pereat: ‘Iuppiter ut Chaly-
bum omne genus pereat’ Catull. 66. 48 ;
¹ ut'=‘utinam‚’ as in Virg. Aen. 10.
631.

44. nee, used by Horace where stricter
prose usage would require ‘neve'3 see
on Od. 3. 29. 6.

45. melius, sc. ‘ erit.‘ Cp. ‘ optimum
erat,' supr. v. 7. So in a threat, Liv. 3.
48 ‘ quiesse erit melius.'
