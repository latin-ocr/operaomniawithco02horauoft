LIB. Ι.

Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino

Atque quibusdam aliis, melius quod scribere possem,
Inventore minor; neque ego illi detrahere ausim
Haerentem capiti cum multa laude coronam.

At dixi fluere hunc lutulentum, saepe ferentem
ς Plura quidem tollenda relinquendis.
4Τυ nihil in magno doctus reprehendis Homero?

Nil comis tragici mutat Lucilius Acci?
Non ridet versus Enni gravitate minores,

Cum de se loquitur non ut maiore reprensis?

Varrone Atacino. P. Terentius
Varro, called ‘ Atacinus ' from his birth-
place on the river Atax (Ande) in Gallia
Narbonensis. His Satires are not men-
tioned elsewhere. Quintilian’s mention
of him (10. 1. 87) recognises the fact
that some of his poems did not merit
immortality, ‘in iis, per quae nomen est
assecutuS, interpres operis alieni‚’ with
reference no doubt to his Argonautica,
a poem frequently referred to by later
poets (as Ov. Fast. 2. 439).

47. quibusdam aliis. Macleanejustly
remarks that but for this reference we
should not have known that Varro had
written Satires3 it is not surprising that
there were other writers whose names
are not preserved.

48. inventore minor. Cp. Sat. 2.
1. 74 ‘ Quicquid sum ego, quamvis Infra
Lucili censum ingeniumque,² etc.

49. haerentem, as though it would
be unwilling to be removed.

50. at, ‘ but, you repeat (see on verse
Ι), Ι said‚' etc. Ritter unnecessarily
makes it more directly dramatic by
reading ex conj. ‘dixti.’ The reference
is to Sat. 1. 4. 1 1, where see note.

52. doctus, ‘are you not learned
critic enough to pick some holes, like
the Alexandrines, in Homer’? For a
reference to such criticisms see A. P.

{3- cornis: not ironical, but yet an
epithet taken from his admirers, as in
verse 85, ‘ for all his graciousness.'

tragici has the force of ‘the true
tragic poet.’

mutat, ⁶ emendat ' Porph.

Acci. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 56, A. P. 258,
L. Accius, born, according to Jerome, in

13.C. 170. His tragedies are praised
and frequently quoted by Cicero. Quin-
tilian’sjudgment (10. 1. 97) is ‘ Tragoe-
diae scriptores Accius atque Pacuvius
clarissimi gravitate sententiarum, ver-
borum pondere, et auctoritate person-
arum. Ceterum nitor et summa in
excolendis operibus manus magis videri
potest temporibus, quam ipsis defuisse)
Porphyrion's comment on this and the
following lines is ‘ Facit autem haec
Lucilius cum alias tum vel maxime in
tertio libro . . . et nono et decimo.'

54. gravitate: Epp. 2. 1. 59 ; not the
abl. ofcomparison as Orelli takes it, con-
structing ‘ Enni ’ ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘ versus'
and ‘ gravitate,' ⁴ verses of Ennius, below
the dignity of Ennius ' 3 but the abl. of
respect, as Epp. 2. 1. 183 ‘virtute et
honore minores.' Servius on Virg. Aen.
11. 601 (see Conington, i. l.) illustrating
Virgil's use of the verb ⁴ horreo‚’ has
preserved an instance of Lucilius⁷
criticism of Ennius, ‘Est autem versus
Ennianus (probably Sat. 3. fr. 6 ‘Sparsis
hastis longis campus splendet et horret ²)
vituperatus a Lucilio dicente per irrisio-
nem eum debuisse dicere, “horret et
alget.’⁷ '

55. ‘ Whilst he speaks of himself not
as though he were greater than those he
critieizes.’ eum almost=‘ cum tamen.'
Heindorf makes this a separate question,
understanding a second ‘loquitur,' ‘ when
he speaks of himself is it not as one
greater than those he criticizes’3 but
Madvig (Opusc. i. p. 106) rightly
pointed out that, even if the double
ellipsis of ‘loquitur' and of the prep.
before ‘ maiore ‘ were admitted, the sense
would be wrong. Horace is arguing
that criticism of your predecessors is no
proof of disrespect to thern.
