HORATII ARS POETICA.

421

Omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat.
Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris,
Ne quodcunque velit poscat sibi fabula credi,

Neu pransae Lamiae vivum puerum extrahat alvo.

340

Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis,
Celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ramnes:
Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,
Lectorem delectando pariterque monend03

Hic meret aera liber Sosiis; hic et mare transit

345

Et longum noto scriptori prorogat aevum.
Sunt delicta tamen quibus ignovisse velimus;

337. ‘If your hearer has had enough
any further words are wasted and soon
forgotten '. Bentley unfortunately took
‘pectore' of the poet's heart (thinking
of the use of ‘ mano⁷ in Epp. 1. 19. 447,
and so found the line dull and suspected
interpolation.

supervacuum: Od. 2. 20. 24, Epp.
1·. 1 . .

33583H0race is not giving the full
conditions of poetry which is to please,
but a single rule for poetry which aims
at pleasing only. Extravagant use of
the marvellous (τὸ τερατῶδες,νν111611 Aris-
totle Poet. 14. 2 excludes from Tragedy)
is a natural fault in imaginative writing
which has no moral purpose. He may
have special instances in view.

339. ne. The MSS. vary between
‘ne' and ‘nee‚⁷ B having ‘nec‚’ and
Cruquius reading it without remark.
The source of any such confusion is
shown in B which has in the following
line N. ‘Ne' is preferred by Bentley
as suiting better with ‘neus and he
’ takes it, no doubt rightly. as in v. 185,
q.v.‚ as final, introducing illustrations of
the purpose of the precept in v. 338.

velit has better MS. authority than
‘ volet‚’ and was read by Acr. Keller
in his Epilegomena prefers ‘volet‚' in
spite of this⁷ as the most likely to have
been altered. Either is suitable.

340. Lamiae. Λαμία was a Greek
bugbear to frighten children, Arist.
Vesp. 1177. Suidas s. v. gives the
legend that she was a Libyan queen
whose children Here slew from jealousy‚
and who became a monster preying on
the children of others.

pransae implies that Horace is pur-
posely making such extravagances rather

ridiculous.

341. centuriae seniorum. For this
metaphorical use of the old Tullian clas-
sification cp. v. 113. The ‘seniores’
were over 45.

agitant, ‘ attaek,’ ‘ criticize severely‘;
‘agitat rem militarem' Cic. Mur. 9.
21 ; possibly ‘ hunt off the stage.'

expertia frugis: as ‘austera poe—
mata‚’ in the next line, is their own
phrase; see on v. 3²2·

342. Ramnes: the first of the three
centuries of knights of the original erea-
tion, Liv. 1. 13. They seem to stand
hele for the young men of old family.
The idea of youth comes partly from
the epithet ‘ celsi ’ ; cp. ‘ sublimis ' of a
young man, v. 165, and Liv. 7. 16 ‘ celsi
et spe haud dubia feroces in proelium
vadunt’; but also from the contrast
with ‘ centuriae seniorurn,⁷ the humdrum
respectability of the one class and the
youth of the other being left to be ga-
thered in each ease from the words
that characterize the other members of
the comparison.

343. punctum : Epp. 2. 2. 99.

345. Sosiis: Epp. 1. 20. 2.

mare transit: see on Epp. 1. 20. 13
and cp. Od. 2. 20. 17—20.

346. prorogat: C. S. 67. longum
is pred. =‘ ita ut longum fiat.‘

347. tamen. The adversative par-
ticle is explained not by any single
statement that has been made and that
needs limiting‚ but by the general pic-
ture of ideal perfection which has been
held up to the poet—‘ though my stand-
ard seems so high,' yet, etc.

ignovisse: for the perf. inf. see on

Od. 3. 4. 52, and ep. supr. v. 98.
