306 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Think whether
after all the peace of a private life is not the happiest thing. Think of me in

my Sabine valley with my books, my modest eompetence, and my contented
mind.

96-1 1 2. But through it all do not lose sight of the true ends of life.

On the general subject of the Epistle and its relation to Ep. 17 see the intro·
duction to that Epistle. The subject of a dependent's behaviour is continued, but
in a different vein ; this time in a letter which has, in part at least, close relations to
the circumstances of Lollius. It is not a needy man making up to a patron for a
dinner and sor the benefit of his relations (Ep. 17. 21N, but a man born in good
position. The Epistle speaks (vv. 60—64) of his father’s estate, and he is probably
the Lollius of Ep. 2, and the son of the Lollius who was consul in Rc. 21 (Ep.
20. 28). He is thought of as entering the sriendship not of some merely rich
patron, but of a ‘potens amicus‚' a man high in the politica] world, with secrets of
importance which his protegi must respect and keep (vv. 37, 38 and 653-70)‚ The
Epistle, however, is not free from difficulties. The dangers against which Lollius
is warned in vv. 21-36 and 72—75 seem ill suited to the kind of character pre-
sumed in the rest of the poem; and, taking the Epistle as a whole, and supposing
that Lollius had really attached himself to some one of high position in the Court
circle, it is not easy to believe that its immediate publication can have been agree·
able either to patron or pr'otdgd. This last supposition, however, is not necessary.
The conditions of the case are satisfied if Lollius, a young literary friend of the
poet, was contemplating the acceptance of such an office as that which Augustus
himself offered to Horace, or that which Celsus holds in Ep. 83 and if Horace
wrote to him, perhaps at his request, sketching the duties and dangers of a private
secretary in a great house. Part of the lecture may have been evidently playful,
and the issue of the Epistle may have been that Lollius declined the office.

It is to be noticed that any disrespeet to Lollius is out of the question, supposing
him to be the person we imagine. It seems also that the Epistle was written in
B. C. 20 (see on v. 56 and introd. to the Epistles‚ p. 207‘5 and published therefore
within a few months.

SI bene te novi, metues, liberrime Lolli,

Scurrantis speciem praebere, professus amicum.

Ut matrona meretrici dispar erit atque

Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.

Est huic diversum vitio vitium prope maius, 5

‘ I arn sure from
my knowledge of you.y An habitual

1. Si bene te novi. eorrespond to difference of kind (cp.

use of ‘ dispar ' in Epod. 7. 12). Cp. the

phrase: Sat. 1. 9. 22 ‘ si bene me novi‚'
Sen. Epp. 16. 6 ‘ iam ab initio si bene te
novi circumspicies?

metues: Od. 2. 2. 7 n.

liberrime Lolli, ‘my frankest Lol-
lius.’ Cp. ‘ liber amicus ⁷ Sat. 1. 4. 132 ;
the epithet explains the ‘ si bene te novi.'
Horace's sear for him is on the side, not
of subservienee, but of too ⁸ brusque ' in-
dependence.

2. scurrantis: see Epp. 1. 17. 19.

3. dispar . . . atque discolor, the
difference of tint, i. e. tone (cp. ‘vitae
color ' Sat. 2. ι. 60, Epp. 1. 7. 23), will

comparison of bought love and true
affection in Od. 1. 35. 25—28.

4. distabit, with dat., as Od. 4. 9. 29,
Epp. 1. 7. ²3 ; cp. ⁴ diversum huic vitio '
in the following verse, and see Madv.
247 b, obs> 3.

5. est, ἔστι. ‘ There is something the
very opposite of this vice, yet a vice also
(the collocation ⁴‘ vitio vitium ’' implies
“both are vices '’; cp. “ viro vir ” Od. 3.
1. 5 n), and perhaps (cp. use of “ prope ''
in v. 28, Epp. 1. 6. 1, A. P. 432) a greater
one.'
