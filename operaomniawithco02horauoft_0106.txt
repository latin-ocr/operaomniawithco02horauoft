94 HORATII SATIRARUM

Cognati, quis te salvo est opus?'
‘ Felices! nunc ego resto.

Omnes composui.'

‘Haud mihi quisquam.

Confice; namque instat fatum mihi triste Sabella

Quod puero cecinit divina mota anus urna: 30
Hunc neque dira venena nec hosticus auferet ensis

Nec laterum dolor aut tussis, nec tarda podag1·a;

Garrulus hunc quando consumet cunque: loquaces

Si sapiat vitet simul atque adoleverit aetas'

Ventum erat ad Vestae, quarta iam parte diei 35
Praeterita, et casu tunc respondere vadato

27. quis te salvo est opus, as we
should say, ‘ to take care of you.’

haud. mihi quisquam ς the purpose
of the answer is to put a full stop to the
topic which Horace has started.

28. This and what follows to v. 34 is
supposed to be said aside‚ as is clear
from its provoking no answer.

30. divina mota urna: all ablatives,
though the Schol. took ‘ mota'z‘ com-
mota‚’ ‘ excita‚⁷ as a nom. For ‘ mota
urna ' cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 432 ‘ Quaesitor
Miuosurnam movet.’ With ‘divina urna‚’
Bentl. (who, for himself, wished to read
‘ mota divina anus urna‚’ making ‘ divina ’
nom.) compares Sil. Ital. 3. 344 ‘divina-
rumque sagacem Flammarum.' The refer-
ence is to divination by means of‘ sortes:
or written slips dropped in a vessel and
drawn or shaken out. They would con-
sist of ambiguous sentences which the
⁴ sortilegus ' would apply as prophecies
to the persons who drew them. Cicero
describes it in Div. 2. 41, and speaks of
it as an art already discredited. This and
other forms of witchcrast would linger
among the Sabine hill folk: Epod. 17.
28, with note. The whole picture here
is imaginary and burlesque.

31. hosticus, archaic form of ‘hos-
tilis’ Od. 3. 2. 6; cp. ‘ civicus ’ Od. 2. 1.
1.n.‚ Epp. 1. 3. 23.

32. laterum dolor, ‘pleuritis' Comm.
Cxuq. Orelli reminds us that Crassus,
in Cic. de Orat. 3. 2, dies of ‘lateris
dolor.'

33. quandocunque, ‘ whenever that
time comes ’ ; the construction is ellipti-
cal, as with ‘ quicunque‚' ‘qualiscunque,'
etc. Bentl. quotes Ov. Met. 6. 544
‘ Quandocumque mihi poenas dabis‚’
Trist. 3. 1. 57 ‘Quandocumque precor
nostro placata parenti, Isdem snb do-

minis aspiciare domus? For the tmesis
see on Od. 1. 6. 3.

35. ad Vestae. Burn (Rome and the
Campagna, p. 78) takes this to include
the Regia tsee on Od. 1. 2. 15, 165
which stood between the Sacra Via and
the actual temple of Vesta, to which it
was attached. The two had now reached
the Forum, which gives Horace this
chance of deliverance. His own route
would diverge to the left if he were
to make for the Tiber and the Iani-
culum.

quarta parte. The third hour was
over and the fourth beginning. Law
business, according to Martial 4. 8. 2,
began with the third, ‘ Exercet raucos
tertia causidicos.'

36. respondere vadato. The plain-
tiff in a civil suit when, with the Praetor⁷s
leave, he had declared the nature and
process of his action, had to give
the defendant time to prepare his
answer. He called on him therefore
‘ dare vades‚' and was said‘ vadari reum‚’
to bind him over to appear. If the de-
fendant failed at the appointed time to
come into court (‘ vadimonium sistere‚'
‘respondere,' or apparently as here
‘ respondere vadato‚’ he was said ‘ vadi-
monium deseruisses and the plaintiff
moved for judgment. ‘ ut ex edicto bona
possidere liceat.' See a ease in Cic. pro
Quint. 6. ‘Vadato' then is dat. No
other instance of the actual phrase is
found, ‘respondere ’ being usually abso-
lute. It has been, therefore, proposed
by some editors to take ‘vadato' as
an abl. absol. like ¹auspicato,' 616.
Bentley wished to read ‘ vadatus} which,
as he showed‚ is found in a passive
sense.
