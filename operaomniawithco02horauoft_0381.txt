LIB. ΙΙ.

Ῑ116 ferat pretium poenae securus, opinor.
Prudens emisti vitiosum3 dicta tibi est lex:
Insequeris tamen hunc et lite moraris iniqua?

Dixi me pigrum proficiscenti tibi, dixi

Talibus officiis prope mancum, ne mea saevus
Iurgares ad te quod epistula nulla rediret.

Quid tum profeci mecum facientia iura

Si tamen attemptas? Quereris super hoc etiam, quod

Exspectata tibi non mittam carmina mendax.

Luculli miles collecta viatica multis
Aerumnis‚ lassus dum noctu stertit, ad assem

even though its effect has been dis-
counted by explanations which make it
come when used almost as if it were in
jest. It is difficult also in this inter-
pretation to see any purpose in the con-
dition. It is a truism to say ‘ you would
pay the money, if you were satisfied
with the terms.' Another objection is
that any such double apodosis divided
between the purchaser and the vendor
ought to be answered to by a division
of the lesson of the apologue between
Florus and Horace, whereas in the in-
terpretation (v. 20 foll.) Horace only is
concemed. The whole moral is ‘You
must not expect more thau you were
promised.’

excepta. For the use of‘excipere’
and for another reference to the obliga-
tion on a vendor of a slave to warn the
purchaser of defects see Sat. 2. 3. 286
‘ mentem nisi litigiosus Exciperet domi-
nus cum venderet? The law of the
question is stated by Cicero in de Off.
3. 17. 71 ‘in mancipiorum venditione
venditoris fraus omnis excluditur. Qui
enim scire debuit de sanitate, de fuga, de
furtis, praestat edicto aedilium) The
morality is discussed in de Rep. 3.

918. prudens emisti. Horace adopts
the measured tone of counsel advising a
would—be litigant, or of a judge dismiss-
ing the case.

diota tibi est lex best taken, after
Porph.‚ ‘cum conditione emisti‚' ‘you
were told the conditions of sale.' Orelli
thinks it can mean ‘you have heard the
law,’ i.e. ‘there is the decision, the
court has done with you.'

19. lite moraris iniqua, your action
is ‘ frivolous and vexatious.'

21. mea, ‘on my side.' It stands

first in the sentence, to matt-h rediret
(which means ‘in answer to yours ⁷> at
the end of it: see Introduction.

23. mecum facientia: Epp. 2. Ι. 68.
It is a Ciceronian phrase, as Caecin. 28.
79 ‘rem et sententiam interdicti mecum
faeere fatebatur.'

24, attempta& ‘ attaek‚⁷ ‘ attempt to
shake? It seems also a legal term.

super hoc: perhaps best ‘ about this,’
as Od.3.8.17‚ 4. 2. 42, C. S. 1S; Epp.
2. Ι. 152; A. P. 429. Orelli takes it,
as Sat. 2. 6. 3, as ‘besides this'; the
object clause quod, etc. depending
directly on quereris.

25. carmina, se. lyrical poemS, as
we see in v. 59 ; 566 also v. 91 n.

mendax, ‘breaking my promise.' Cp.
1. 7. 2.

26. For the abrupt introduction of
the apologue cp. Epp. Ι. 7. 46. Lu-
culli miles⁷ a soldier ‘scrving under
Lucullus, in the war against Mithridates';
see v. 30 ‘praesidium regales Keller
points out that the fixing of this story
on one of Lucullus' soldiers corresponds
with what Plutarch tells us in his life
of Lucullus (ch. 33 and 35), of his un-
popularity with his men ; that they
would reject his greeting, showing him
their empty purses, and bidding him
advanee alone to dangers from which
he alone would grow rich.

viatica must have meant originally
equipment or travelling money; but it
seems to be used for a soldier's savings
or private purse; see Tac. Ann. 1. 37.

27. ad assem, to the last ‘as ’;
the model of‘ ad unum.’
