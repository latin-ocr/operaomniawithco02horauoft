170 HORATII SATIRARUM

27—44. If a case is being heard in the forum, and one party is a rich man without
children, ask nothing more —espouse his cause—address him by his praeno-
men—make him go home and nurse himself, and leave his case in your hands:
stick to it through midsummer or midwinter. Your assiduity and energy will
attract attention and open the way to other ventures.

45—50. Look also for a rich man with one sickly heir. It is really a saser game
than one evidently without heirs.

51-55. Is you are offered a will to read, refuse it steadily; yet in putting it
from you manage to catch a side glance at the second line on the first page ;
see if your name is there, and alone or with others.

55—59. There are many slipS. A Coranus will osten outwit a Nasica!

58. Clysses. ‘ What can you mean? Are you jesting with me?'

59—60. Tiresias. ‘ Do not laugh at my prophecieS. They are as true as all
prophecy.’

61. L'lysscs. ‘ Explain.'

62-69. Tiresias. ‘ It is a tale of the days of Aeneas' great descendant. Nasica will
give his daughter to Coranus in the hope of a legacy which shall free him from
debt. Coranus will hand him his will to read ; after much refusal Nasica will
take it and find himself disappointed.

70—83. My further instructions. If your patron is under the rule of some dis-
honest dependents, make up to them. Humour his own tasteS.

84-88. Be warned by the story of the old woman of Thebes, who was determined
to slip through her heirs' fingers after her death as she had not done so while
alive.

89-91. There are dangers on both sides: too little zeal and too much,loquacity
and silence.

91—98. Play the obsequious slave of the stage—watch your patron’s needs and
whims.

99-1c6. Do not drop your attentions when he is dead and you find yourselslest
with a quarter of his property. Cain credit by show of your feeling.

107-109. Make up to one of your coheirs.

109-110. But Proserpine summotis me—I must away.’
