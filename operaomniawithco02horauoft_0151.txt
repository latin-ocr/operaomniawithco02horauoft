LIB. II.

SAT. 3. 139

Insanit veteres statuas Damasippus emendo:

Integer est mentis Damasippi creditor? Esto! σέ

Accipe quod nunquam reddas mihi, si tibi dicam,

Tune insanus eris si acceperis? an magis excors

Reiecta praeda quam praesens Mercurius fert?

‘Scribe decem a Nerio; non est satis: adde Cicutae
Nodosi tabulas centum, mille adde catenas: 70

64, 65. insanit . . . creditor. These
are the two judgments of the supposed
opponent which Stertinius, after ironi-
cally allowing them (eston, proceeds
to show to be inconsistent with one
another.

integer mentis, as ‘integer vitae’
Od. 1. 22. 1.

66-76. Stertinius propounds a di-
lemma: he personates the ‘creditor
Damasippi,⁷ and imagines two alterna-
tive forms under which he may offer
his loan to his insolvent borrower. He
may say at once ‘ Take it and don't
repay it.’ In that case surely Dama-
sippus is not mad if he assents. Or he
may demand bonds and securities‚ which
are as useless as the attempts to bind
Proteus. In that case he is at least the
madder of the two.

66. accipe quod nunquam reddas
=‘accipe hoe ea conditione ut non
reddas?

67. excors: Epp. 1. 2. 25, ‘sense-
less.’

68. Mercurius: see on v. 25. The
Greeks called a windfall or lucky ven-
ture ἑρμαῖον.

69-71. The general sense, as explained
on v. 66, is clear; but even the Scho-
liasts were in doubt as to the technical
terms and the significance of the names.

69. scribe decem a Nerio. Either
‘Enter (on the debtor side of your ac-
count) ten (sestertia Ρ) from Nerius} or
‘Sign ten bonds <‘tabulas’ understood
from the next clause) of Nerius’s'
Diintzer quotes Cic. Att. 16. 7 ‘ Antonii
edictum legi a Bruto,' as meaning ‘after
Brutus‚' ie. in his style. lf this were so
it would suit, but query whether it does
not mean ‘received from Brutus.' In
either case Nerius must not be taken
to be a real party to the transaction. but
to be the stern money-lender‚ (oras Profs.
Palmer and Maguire suggest, banker,
through whom the money was to be
advanced),Lw-hi-el÷ the ‘ creditor Dama-

 

sippi' is supposed to use in order to
make his debtor understand the terms
on which he stands; ‘Understand that
you are borrowing as from (or through)
Nerius.' Persius kz. 14. takes the name
of Nerius from this place, and the Scho-
liast explains that he was ‘fenerator
notissinms.' As between the two expla-
nations os the ellipsis with ‘decem,⁷ both
offered by the Scholiast, it is difficult to
choose. A satisfactory parallel for the
ellipsis of ‘ sestertia’ is quoted by Bent-
ley ton Epp. 2. 1. 105) from the Digest
12. c. 40 ·L. Titius scripsi me acce-
pisse a P. Maevio quindecim mutua,'——
the formula of a note of hand. On the
other hand, it is difficult to separate
‘decem' entirely from ‘centum’ and
‘mille‚’ as that explanation compels
us to do. ‘Decem tabulas’ is not
literal any more than ‘centum tabulas?
It is an attempt to give to degrees of
intensity a numerical expression: ‘Sign
ten times over, a hundred times over,
binding agreements.⁷

non est satis, If ‘scribe decem a
Nerio' is, as seems Iofflliable, in the
mouth of the supposed ‘creditor‚' the
words that follow are Stertinius' com-
ment, urging him on to more precau-
tions‚ but telling him beforehand that
they are all idle. ‘Cicuta' (see inf. v.
175) has the air of a nick-name (see
below on v. 75), ‘ fenerator qui propter
asperitatem et amaritudinem cognomi-
natus est ' Schol.

70. nodosi, ‘with his knots.’
association seems twofold : (1) with the
use of‘ nodus' of tangled and intricate
points of law (ι iuris nodos'Juv. S. S. 50);
(2) with the use of legal subtleties for
purposes of constraint and oppression.
Cp. Lucretius' frequent use of ‘nodus'
‘ nodi religionum‚' etc. Notice that this
word seems to suggest the metaphor of
‘ catenas,' and the full figure of Proteus
and the attempts to bind him.
