HORATII SATIRARUM

Quorsum abeant? Sani ut creta, an carbone notati?
Aedificare casas, plostello adiungere mures,

Ludere par impar, equitare in arundine longa,

Si quem delectet barbatum, amentia verset.

Si puerilius his ratio esse evincet amare,

Nec quicquam differre utrumne in pulvere, trimus
Quale prius, ludas opus, an meretricis amore
Sollicitus plores, quaero, faciasne quod olim
Mutatus Polemon? ponas insignia morbi,

FasciolaS, cubital, focalia, potus ut ille

vagance directed by the caprice which
delights in contravening natural dis-
tinctions.

impenso : in prose ‘impenso pretio,'
⁶ at large cost.'

prandere : no distinction is probably
intended between the ‘ prandium ' or
early meal‚ and ‘cena’ the later, as
though an extravagant luncheon were
worse than an extravagant dinner. Cp.
Epp. 1.17. 13, A. P. 340.

coemptas : Sat. 1. 2. 9.

246. ¹ Into which class shall they go?
Marked with chalk as sane men or
with charcoal (as insane) ’θ’ See on
Od. 1. 36. 10. The expression ‘with
chalk or charcoal ' is of course prover—
bial; cp. Pers. Sat. 5. 108 ‘Illa prius
creta mox haec carbone notasti?⁷ Some
doubt overhangs the reading of ‘ sani
ut,' variants being ‘ sani aut,' ‘ sani an,'
‘ sani.' If it is to be displaced, it should
be rather in favour of the last, the read-
ing of two of the Blandinian MSS„ than
in favour of Bentley's conj. ‘ sanin‚' i.e.
‘ sanine.’ ‘ Notandi ’ has been adopted
by some editors, but against the great
weight of MSS.

247—280. He turns to the madness of
foolish attachments‚ connected with
the last as another cause of extrava-
gance.

247. aedificare casas: the first of
a series of childish amusements. It is
probably taken up again in ‘in pulvere
. . . ludas opus’ v. 251, and therefore
means castle—building on the sand, ὡς
ὅτε τις ψάμαθον παῖς α”γχι θαλάσσης, Ι ὅς
τ’ ἐπεὶ οὖν ποιήσῃ ἀθύρματα νηπιέῃσιν, Ι
ἂψ αὖτις συνέχευε ποσὶν καὶ χερσὶν
ἀθύρων Hom. 11. 15. 363. Had Roman
children boxes of bricks2

248. ludere par impar-edpndgew,

Arist. Plutus 816. It was played with

²55

‘ tali’ or with coins or counters which
could be held in the hand (sometimes
walnuts, Nux Eleg. 795, one holding,
the other guessing whether the number
was odd or even.

equitare in arundine : a recognised
child’s play. So Plutarch's Apoph-
thegm. Laconica of Agesilaus 270)
μικροῖς τοῖς παιδίοις κάλαμον περιβεβηκὼς
ὥσπερ ἵππον οἴκοι συνέπαιζεν.

249. amentia verset, ‘it must be
madness turning his head' ε no one could
doubt it.

2 50. ratio evincet, as ‘vincet' above,
v. 22 5.

amare, absol. Epp. 2. 1. 171.

251. utrumne: Sat. 2. 6. 73. So in
direct question Epod. 1. 7, where see
note.

252- ludas opus : referring back
chiefly to ‘aedificare casas’; ‘ opus’
being specially used of building opera-
tions‚ fortifications, etc. For ‘ludere '
with accus. for doing things in play
cp. Virg. G. 4. 565 ‘ carmina qui lusi.'

254. Polemon. The story of the re-
form of Polemon was a commonplace.
It is told, amongst other places, in
Lucian, Bis Aecus. 16, 17. He heard
Xenocrates lecturing as he passed his
school, entered, was changed by what
he heard, and eventually succeeded to
his chair.

2 55. fasciolas: some kind of stock-
1n 5.

g{zubitaL a pillow for the elbow to
rest on at banquets.

focalia, ⁴ a scarf for the neck.' They
are called here ‘insignia morbi‚’ as
badges of luxury and extramgance,
additions to the ordinary dress which
only the effeminate and luxurious would
wear. Cp. Quintil. 11. 3. 144 ‘Pallio-
lum, sicut fascias, quibus crura vestiuntur,
