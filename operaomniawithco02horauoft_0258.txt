HORATII EPISTULARUM

Porrigere: ‘Hic multum in Fabia valet, ille Velina3
Cui libet hic fasces dabit eripietque curule

Cui volet importunus ebur.'

Frater, Pater, adde ;

Ut cuique est aetas, ita quemque facetus adopta. 55
Si bene qui cenat bene vivit, lucet, eamus

Quo duct gula, piscemur, venemur, ut olim

Gargilius, qui mane plagas, venabula, servos

Differtum transire forum populumque iubebat,

Unus ut e multis populo spectante referret 60
Emptum mulus aprum. Crudi tumidique lavemur,

Quid deceat, quid non, obliti, Caerite cera

Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulixei,

Cui potior patria fuit interdicta voluptas.

Si, Mimnermus uti censet, sine amore iocisque 65

by Gesner and is supported by Lachmann
on Lucret. 6. 574. It is given by
Ritter. (4) It has lately been explained
of weighted tassels attached to the dress
in order to make it sit properly, such as
are represented in monuments, and such
as have been found in Etruscan tombs
(Dennis‚ Cities and Cemeteries of Etru-
ria, vol. 2. p. 515). lt is difficult how-
ever to see how, if this is the sense, it
adds anything to the picture.

52. Fabia . . . Velina, sc. ‘ tribu)
Horace apparently takes two names of
tribes at random. Pers. 5. 73, probably
in imitation of him, has ‘Velina.'

53. hie, not the ‘ hic' of v. 52, buta
third citizen. Some good MSS. (in-
cluding Regin.) have ‘ is,' which Bentley
defends.

54. importunus, with eripiet) rough-
1y,' ‘ ruthlessly ; ' see on Od. 4. 13. 9.

frater: so Juv. S. 5. 135, Virro to
Trebius, when his fortune has come to
him, ‘ Vis. frater, ab ipsis Ilibus?' See
Mayor's note.

55. facetus, ‘blande et comiter ' Orell.
The quotations sor this use are from
Plautus and Terence.

56. lueet: ‘let us start at daybreak
and prepare for our feast!

57. piscemur, venemur. ‘ Let us go
fishing and hunting‚ not in the way that
involves manly exercise, but after Gar-
gilius' easy fashion.' The story is sug-
gested by the metaphorieal use of
‘ vene1nur‚' and adds nothing to it.

60. populo. The repetition means
the same people that saw him go out.

61. erudi: used both of undigested
food and persons in a state of indiges-
tion. See Sat. 1. 5. 49. For the practice
spoken of cp. Pers. Sat. 3. 98 ‘Turgidus
hic epulis atque albo ventre lavatur,'
ete„ Juv. S. 1.142 ‘Poena tamen praesens,
cum tu deponis amictus Turgidus et
crudum pavonem in balnea portas.' See
May0r⁷s note there.

62. quid deceat. There must be no
back—glances at ideals you have for-
sworn.

Caerite cera digni, ‘ worthy of the
register of Caere.’ This phrase, which
does not occur elsewhere, is explained
by the Scholiasts and by A. Gellius 16.1 3
to be the equivalent of ‘ qui in aeran'os
reserantur,' that is, to be reduced to the
condition of ‘ civitas sine suffragi0‚' ‘ dis-
franchised.' The origin of the phrase is
traced by Gellius to the story told in
Liv. 5. 40 f., of the services rendered by
Caere to Rome during the Gallie inva-
sion and its consequent reward of an
honorary citizenship, by the Scholiasts
to the occasion of the later rebellion
of Caere (Liv. 7. 20) when the citizen-
ship originally given was limited in this
way as a punishment. The matter is
discussed by Madv. Opusc. vol. 1. p. 240.

63. remigium Ulixei: cp. the in—
terpretation of this story in Epp. 1.
2. 23 f.

64. interdieta, voluptas. With par-
ticular reference perhaps to the slaughter
of the cattle of the Sun, Hom. Od. 12.
271 f.
