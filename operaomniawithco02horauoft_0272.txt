HORATII EPISTULARUM

Multum dissimiles, at cetera paene gemelli—

Fraternis animis quicquid negat alter et alter—

Annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi. 5
Tu nidum servas; ego laudo ruris amoeni

Rivos ct musco circumlita saxa nemusque.

Quid quaeris? Vivo et regno simul ista reliqui

Quae vos ad caelum effertis rumore secundo:

thue sacerdotis fugitivus liba recuso3 10
Pane egeo iam mellitis potiore placentis.

Vivere naturae si convenienter oportet,

Ponendaeque domo quaerenda est area primum,

much, but in all else nearly twin brethren
with brotherly hearts (when one says
“ n0,'' the other says “ no '’ tool, we nod
in time like two old familiar doves.’
The punctuation of these lines has been
the subject of great difference. I follow
Dillf. and (in the main point) Orelli.
Bentley has induced many modern editors
<including Munro, Ritter, Keller) to put
a strong stop at ‘ amatores ’ and another
at ‘ pariter,’ leaving ⁶ vetuli notique co-
lumbi’ to begin a new sentence. But
the figure of the two old doves on a
perch has grown out of the description
of the two old friends, ‘ gemelli,’ ¹ fra-
ternis animis‚' with the picture—suggest—
ing ‘annnimus pariter.' The metaphor
is carried on by a fresh departure in ⁶ tu
nidum servas) etc. ; but there would be
little point in the epithet ‘noti vetulique,’
if the doves belonged wholly to vv. 6, 7.
In any punctuation and rendering there
is something harsh in the change in
the meaning of the plural first person
from ‘I' inv. 2 to ‘you and I' inv. 5.

2. scilieet is used particularly by
Horace (see esp. Od. 1. 37. 30, 2. 14. 9,
4. 8. 5) as in our view it is used here,
with adjectives (or participles) to call
special attention⁷ whether in irony or
not, to the relation between the adj. and
the main statement.

6. One is a stay-at-home‚ the other
tanges sar afield for things to admire.

7. circumlita: perhaps a word of
the painter's art, of rocks ‘touched,'
‘ coloured,’ with patches of moss or
lichen. Cp. ‘oblitus' Epp. 2. 1. 104,
⁶ illinet' Epp. 1. 7. 10.

8. quid. quaeris? a colloquial phrase
implying ‘ ask no more‚' used either
after an explanation, usually a laconic
one, has been given, or to bespeak at-

tention to one which is to be given and
which must bc sufficient. Cp. Cic. ad
Att. 1.14.7‚1.16.4,and 2. 16. 1, with
XVatson's notes,

vivo : ‘it is real lise' ; Βιός βιωτός.

regno, ‘ rex surn'3 ‘ my mind to me
a kingdom is.' Cp. infr. v. 33.

9. vos: ‘you‚ and those who think
with you ; you townfolk.'

effertis : the reading of V (supported
by σ (St. Gallenll against the majority
of MSS. Both phrases are found else-
where (‘ efferte ad caelum ’ Cic. ad Fam.
9. 14. 1), though ‘ferre’ is the more
common, Sall. Cat. 53. Ι, Jug. 53. S,
Cic. Fam. 10. 26. 2, Lucr. 6. 8.

rumore seeundo, ⁴ amid savouring
voices‚’ ‘with general assent.' See Con-
ington on Virg. Aen. 8. 90 ‘ iter inceptum
celerant rumore secundo.⁷

10, ΙΙ. The ‘pleasures' of town are
to me what sweet cakes are to the slave
who has run away from a priest's house-
hold—the very things which I am tired
of and want to change sor more simple
and wholesome fare.

10. liba. Defined by Servius on Virg.
Aen. 7. 109 as ‘ placentae de farre, melle,
et oleo. sacris aptae.‘

12. naturae convenienter. ‘ Quod
summum bonum a Stoicis dicitur conve-
nienter naturae vivere ’ Cic. de Off. 3. 3.
13, ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει.

‘ Isthe Stoic principle for living is ‘to
be applied to the first prelirninary for
living—namely, choosing a place to live
in.’ There is perhaps a reference to
some proverbial order in the needs oi
life. Cp. Hesiod's οἶκον μὲν πρώτιστα,
κ.τ.λ.’Έ. καὶ Ἡ. 405.

13. ponendae domo.
MSS. had ‘ ponenda‚' but we cannot say
whether by a mistake or by a correction

The Bland.
