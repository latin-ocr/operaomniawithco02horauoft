·’ FRUCTIBUS Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Icci,

Si recte frueris, non est ut copia maior

Ab Iove donari possit tibi.

Tolle querelas 3

Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus.

Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil ,ς
Divitiae poterunt regales addere maius.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus, ut te
Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret;

1. Fructibus quos colligis. ‘ Fruc-
tus’ is used for ‘produce’ of all sorts.
Iccius is a ⁶ procurator ' (see Cic. de Or.
1. 58. 249 with wilkins) note) or man-
ager os the estate of a non-resident
proprietor‚ with a ‘ vilicus ' or ‘ vilici ’
under him. Agrippa tsee on Od. 1. 6
introd.) has estates in Sicily, acquired
possibly (as Ritter suggests) either aster
the battle of Naulochus on the Sicilian
coast, when he defeated Sextus Pom-
peius, 01· in B.C. 21, when Augustus
summoned him to Sicily and gave him
the hand of Julia, Dion C. 54. 6.

2. si reete frueris. It is assumed
that one who collected the produce
lived on the produce. There is probably
a play on ‘fructibus . .. frueris‚’ ‘ if
you enjoy what is meant to be enjoyed ' ;
‘recte‚' ‘as you should‚' possibly in the
literal sense ‘as the law allows you,’
certainly in the moral sense, ‘ as philo-
sophy bids you.’

non est ut: Od. 3. 1. 9 ‘ est ut?

3. tolle: ‘away with: ‘a truce to'
(Coningtonl. Epod. 16. 39 ‘muliebrem
tollite luctum.’

4. cui rerum suppetit usus ε ‘ who
has the full use of property.' Horace
is thinking all through of the juridical
term ‘ususfructus' (see vv. 1, 2), ‘If
you enjoy as you should what by its very
name tells you it was meant to be en-
joyed, it is a true “ ususfructus‚” and
that, as any lawyer will tell you, is as
good as possession.' Cp. Epp. 2. 2. 160
‘Qui te pascit ager, tuus est,’ etc.‚ a
philosophical view which there he re-
inforces by the legal principle that
⁴ usus' for a certain term actually con-
veyed possession. Cp. also Sat. 2. 2.
134.

5. si ventri, etc. Horace is perhaps
¹* ,thinking of Solon’s apophtheg-mm fr. 24

ἶσόν τοι πλουτοῦσιν ὅτῳ πολὺς ἀργυρός

ἐστι Ι καὶ χρυσὸς καὶ ’γῆς πυροφόρου πέδια,[
ἵπποι θ’ ἡμίονοί τε, καὶ ᾦ μόνα ταῦτα πά-
ρεστι Ι ’γαστρί τε καὶ πλευρῇς καὶ ποσὶν
ἁβρὰ παθεῖν.

For lateri ep. Sat. 1. 9, 32, 2. 3. 163;
Epp. 1. 6. 28.

pedibus: i. e. if you are free from
the gout.

7-9. The compliments to Iccius begin
with acertain archness (conveyed by the
hypothetical form ‘ si forte‚’ ‘isto put a
case,' and by the hyperbolical ‘ herbis et
urtica ’)—as though they were half jest;
then the tone becomes graver and unmis-
takeably sincere. They are lightened
again in vv. 19-21 by the half bantering
spirit always roused in Horace by the
differences and paradoxes of philoso-

hers.

p 7. in medio positorum abstemius.
Lambinus seems to have been the first to
suggest the interpretation which has
thenceforth been usually given to these
words, viz. ‘temperate in respect of the
simplest luxuries‚' ‘ abstemius ' being
constructed with the gen. as ‘ abstinens ’
in Od. 4. 9. 37. ‘ In medio posita’ is an
habitual phrase (Sat. 1. 2. 108 ‘Trans-
volat in medio posita et fugientia captat ⁷)
for ‘things accessible to all⁷: cp. ‘ex
medio' Epp. 2. 1. 168 n.

8. urtica : the common nettle. So
Persius, perh. remembering this passage,
‘ mihi festa luce coquatur Urtica ’ 6. 69.
Pliny rN. H. 21. 55) speaks of the young
shoots in spring as pleasant eating.

sic vives protinus, ‘you will con-
tinue so to live.’ For ‘ protinus ' see
Virg. Aen. 9. 339 ‘ felix si protinus illum
Aequasset nocti ludum.'

ut, ‘even supposing that’ ; see on
Epod. 1. 21.

9. confestim: ‘ in a moment?

Fortunae rivus Fortune is looked
on as a Pactolus (⁴ Tibique Pactolus
