LIB. Ι.

Intentum Veneri ;

SAT. 5.

tum immundo somnia visu

Nocturnam vestem maculant ventremque supinum. 85
Quattuor hinc rapimur viginti et milia rhedis,
Mansuri oppidulo quod versu dicere non est,

Signis perfacile est:
Hic aqua;

venit vilissima rerum
sed panis longe pulcherrimus, ultra

Callidus ut soleat humeris portare viator; 90
Nam Canusi lapidosus, aquae non ditior urna
Qui locus a forti Diomede est conditus olim.
Flentibus hinc Varius discedit maestus amicis.

86. rapimur: they had crossed the
pass and their road led down to the
Apulian plain.

87 quod versu dicere non est.
Ov. Met. 3. 4 ··‘S quod tangere non est?
Virg. G. 4. 447 ‘neque est te fallere
quicquam! Cp Sat. 2. 5. 103, Epp.
1.1. 32. Orelli prefers to understand

‘facile' from the contiasted clause. The
whole expression is from Lucilius, 6. 39,
whom the Scholiast quoteS, ‘Servorum
est festus dies hic, Quem plane hexametro
versu non dicere possis.’ The Scholiasts
go on to say that the place in question
was Equus Tuticus (or Equotuticus).
This, however, has been clearly proved
to be a mistake. They were misled
by a change in the course of the eastern
branch of the Via Appia which dates
from the reign of Trajan. Equus Tu-
ticus was a stage on this Via Traiana,
twenty-one miles from Beneventum.
Horace and his companions seem to
have taken a line to the South of this.
To have gone by T rivicum to Equus
Tuticus would have been to follow two
sides of a triangle. Vt'alckenaer fixes
on Asculum, which is about the right
distance from Trivieum and on the road
which they seem to have travelled, but
if we remember that Trivicum would
have been unheard of but for this refer-
ence, and that the Scholiasts were at
fault, it will seem more likely that this
‘ oppidulum ’ is one of which the name
has perished.

88. venit vilissima: what is usually
the least expensive thing in the world
has here to be bought. This is the
contrast, not ‘ vilissima ⁹ and ‘pulcher-
rimus.⁷

89. ultra: to further stopping places.
For the carrying of bread on a journey
see on Sat. 1 1. 47.

90. soleat. For lengthening of the
syllable see on Sat. 1. 4. 82.

91. Canusi, Sat. 1.10. 30, 2. 3. 168.
Near the south side of the Aufidus, four-
teen miles from its mouth. In the irn-
mediate neighbourhood was the field
of Cannae. Before reaching Canusium
the old road joined the line of the ‘ Via
Traiana) so that the travellers are again
on a route recognised in the Itineraries.

aquae non ditior urna, agreeing
with ‘ locus ; ' with ‘ aquae non ditior'
cp. the parallel expression in which
Horace makes the same complaint of
Apulia generally, ‘ pauper aquae Daunus ¹
Od. 3. 30. 11 (cp. ‘ siticulosae Apuliae '
Epod. 3. 16). There are still some re-
mains of an aqueduct,which is said to
have been built some 200 years later,
to supply this deficiency, by the wealthy
and munificent rhetorician‚ Atticus
Herodes.

urna: the measure of capacity, as
in Sat. Ι. 1. 54.

92. Bentley (taking ‘urna' in v. 91
as a nom.) would eject this line as dull
and faulty. He criticizes especially the
phrase ‘condere locum‚’ but it may be
justified probably (as Heindorf saysl
by the Greek κτίζειν χώραν, νῆσον, κ.τ.λ.
Orelli thinks point was given to the
line by its being an echo of Ennius.
who in describing Cannae would have
mentioned Canusium. Ritter would lay
stress on ‘forti‚’ the fit founder of a
‘ durum genus,’ who can eat gritty bread
and drink bad water. For the legend
of Diomede’s settlement in Apulia see
Virg. Aen. ΙΙ. 243 foll. Canusium was
one of the towns whose foundation was
attributed to him, Strab. 6. 283, 284.
For its continnous Greek character cp.
Sat. 1. 10. 30 ‘ Canusini bilinguis.’
