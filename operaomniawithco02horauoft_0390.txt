affections. Orelli thinks that it is the
poet's home, which, as he is ‘ musarum
sacerdos‚' has a special sanctity‚ and
which till it is published is the poem's
home. Ritter interprets of taking sanc-
tuary in the temple of Vesta3 but there
is no proof of this usage. Keller ex-
plains ‘ versentur adhuc inter penetralia '
to mean ‘ cling to their place as genuine
relies.' He suggests also, and there is
perhaps more help in this, that the
phrase is a quotation or adaptation
from Ennius or some other elder poet.
It may be noticed that the alliteration
‘ versentur,’ ‘ Vestae,' suits well such an
origin. The key in that case is lost,
and the exact interpretation can only be
matter of conjecture. Possibly, as has
been suggested to me, the words mean
⁸ the innermost shrine of Rome's true
lite’ i. e. as we might say ‘the sanctum
of the Latin language,' ‘the select circle
of genuine Latin words.'
1 15. populo, dat. with obscurata
diu; ⁶ long lost to the people’s view.’
116. speciosa, opp. ‘ quae parum
splendoris habent ' v. 1 1 1. For the word
cp. A. P. 144, 319.
voeabula rerum, ‘ designations of
things,' i. e. words; so ‘ rerum nomina ’
A. P. 57. Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 280 ‘imponens
..vocabula rebus.' They are called
‘ vocabula⁷ alone in A. P. 71.
117. Catonibus atque Cethegis,
‘ such men as Cato &the Censor, consul in
B‚C. 195 ; cp. ‘lingua Catonis' A. P. 56);
‘ and Cethegus ⁷ (consul in 204, the orator
called by Ennius ‘suadae medulll '); cp.
both for the reference and for the plural
‘ cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis ‘ A. P.
50). For the plur. see also on Od. 1.
12. 3 .
1187. situs t the only instance in
Horace of its Virgilian sense of ‘ disuse‚’
‘ inaction.’ Such disuse, in the case of

words, is ‘informis‚’ in that it makes
them uncouth to unaceustomed ears.

119. adsciscet: a return to the figure
of the Censor: ‘ will place on the rolls.’

usus: A. P. 71.

120. vehemens et liquidus: ¹ strong
and yet clear.’ Contrast the description
of Lucilius, Sat. 1. 4. 10 ‘cum flueret
lutulentus’; but Horace is speaking here
of diction only or chiefly. ‘ Vehemens '
is scanned as a disyllable (ep. ‘nihilo '
Sat. 1. 5. 67), but that it was written as
a trisyll. is shown by the emendations
introduced in several MSS„ ‘ Et vehe-
mens,' ‘ Hic vehe1nens,' etc.

122. luxuriantia compescet: the
metaph. from pruning: ‘ramos corn-
pesce fluentis' Virg. G. 2. 370. He
speaks osa too florid diction. Cp. per-
haps A. P. 447 ‘ambitiosa recidet Or-
namenta‚’ and see note there.

sano: i. e. not overdone; for some-
times ‘sectantem levia nervi Deficiunt
animique' A. P. 26.

123. virtute carentia tollet: those
which have no merit in them rneither the
force which leads to redundancy nor that
which conceals itself behind roughness')
he removes. Orelli and Dillr. do not
improve the sense by taking this of a
gmdener, ‘lifting' the weaker shoots
from the ground.

124. et, ‘and yet ' (cp. ‘ ac’ in Od.
3. 28. 6). The meaning seems to be ‘ he
will seem to you to move with the ease
of one at play, but really he will be
putting force on himself, just as the
ease of a stage dancer, who takes first
the agile part and then the heavy part,
is the result of effort and training. Cp.
Pope's imitation—

‘But ease of writing flows from ait

not chance,
As those move easiest who have
learned to dance.'
