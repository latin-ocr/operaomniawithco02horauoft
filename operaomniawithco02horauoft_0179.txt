LIB. II.

SAT. 4. 167

Hoc ubi confusum sectis inferbuit herbis

Corycioque croco sparsum stetit, insuper addes

Pressa Venafranae quod bacca remisit olivae.

Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia suco; 70

Nam facie praestant.

Venucula convenit ollis;

Rectius Albanam fumo duraveris uvam.

Hanc ego cum malis, ego faecem primus et allec,

Primus et invenior piper album cum sale nigro

Incretum puris circumposuisse catillis. 75
Immane est vitium dare milia terna macello

67. sectis herbis. Some such herbs
as are named in Sat. 2. S. 51. It is an
abl. absol. adding a circumstance to the
mixture and the boiling.

68. corycio, from Corycus in Cilicia.

69. Venafranae: see on Od. 2. 6. 15.

remisit: Sat. 2. 8. 53.

70. We have got now to the dessert,
‘ab ovo usque ad mala’ Sat. 1. 3.
6. For the apples of Picenum see
Sat. 2. 3. 272, of Tibur ep. Od. 1.
7. 14.

suco, ‘ flavour,' above v. 13.

71. Venucula. Understand ‘uva’
from the next clause. It is the name
of the kind of grape—not apparently
local. The word is written variously—
‘venicu‘la’ (so in best MSS. of Phny,
who gives the same remark, N. H. 14. 4.
2), ‘ vennuncula,' etc.

convenit ollis, ‘ suits the preserving
Jarsff

72—87. The speaker claims for him-
sels the introduction of these smoke-
dried Alban grapes at desert. This sug-
gests some other original devices of his
own, for putting within reach of all
guests condiments and provocatives os
appetite. This again suggests the irn-
portance of attention to the accessories
of a banquet—especially cleanliness of
table, dinner service, floor, hangings,
etc.

73. hanc, after ‘circumposuisse,’ or
rather, some simple verb meaning ‘to
have served.'

faecem et. allec ε ‘allec‚ saecula Coa’
Sat. 2. 8. 9n. The invention seems
to be leaving them on the table during
the meal.

74. invenior, i. e. those who investi-
gate it find that 1 was the first, ete, as
though a history of the art were being

written. This was the reading of V,
and is generally given. Some good
MSS. have ‘ inveni,' and others ‘in-
ventor,' both perhaps due to scholia
such as Acron's ‘ primus inveni ut allec
condito misceretur! It is a place where
the verb to ‘invent’ and its cognates
corne naturally to the sore when one is
thinking of the general purport, and
not noticing the possibility of con·
fusion.

piper album oum sale nigro. Horace,
or the lecturer, is pleased with the ver-
bal contrast of colour; and the epithets
given, being the opposite of what would
be generally expected, give the idea of
special refinements of taste. White
pepper is described by Pliny as the seed
at an earlier stage than the blaek, and
as being less pungent (N. H. 12. 14. 7).
Black salt seems to refer to the method
of its preparation, ibid. 31. 40. 7.

75. incretum, from ⁴ incerno,’ ‘ sifted
into them.‘ Notice that all the epithets
are directed (1) to make the most ofthe
invention z—it may be a small matter,
but there are great refinements in it:
(2) to lead to the following remarks
on the importance of attending to mi-
nute details.

puris (like ‘ album ‘ and ‘ nigro'), an
epithet for the eye (see on Od. 2. 7. 21),
leads specially to what is to be said on
scrupulous cleanliness. Cp. Od. 2. 16.
13 n.

catillis, the dim. of ‘catinus'; see
Sat. 1. 3. 92. It seems to stand here for
little salt-cellars.

76. immane vitium. A playsul ex-
aggeration.

macello, where the fish itself was
bought, Sat. 2. 3. 229, and in this Satire
v. 37 ‘ cara mensa?
