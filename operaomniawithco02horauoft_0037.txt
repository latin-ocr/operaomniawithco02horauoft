scale of intimates below ⁶ vicini.'

pueri atque puellae. Sat. 2. 3. 130
‘Insanum te omnes pueri clamentque
puellae.’ It has, as Heindorf suggested,
the air os a proverbial expression, and
perhaps only means like ‘old and
young‚’ ‘man and maid,’ and the like,
‘all the world⁷; but compared with
Od. 3. Ι. 4, it may well have the more
definite meaning of ‘the judgment of
the simplest.’

88. an si. This is the reading of B,
of Keller's D, E, of ‘two Bland‚’ and it
is interpreted by Porph. It is supported
by Bentley and of recent editors by
Ritter and Macleane. If we accept it
the sense is plain. Horace has said,
‘ Do you wonder at finding that no one
pays you the love which you are not
eaming’ ἓ He adds an alternative sug-
gestion, ‘ Or can it be that you imagine
that, though Nature gave you the love
of kin without asking for any toil on
your part, it would be a ridiculously
impossible task for you to try to keep
it? ' Bentley justifies the taking ‘ nullo
labore’ for ‘with no labour to you’
by Sen. Apocolocyntosis ‘Sponte sua
festinat opus nulloque labore Mollia
contorto distendunt stamina suso,’ and
id. Epist. 84 ‘quod in corpore nostro
videmus sine ulla opera facere naturam.'
More difficulty is introduced if with
Orelli, Dim, and Munro we read ‘ At
si.' This also has considerable MS. au-
thority. It still leaves it open to us to
point the sentence as a question (as
Munro) and to take it substantially as
before. The majority however of those
who accept it take the sentence cate-

gorically. ‘Nay, should you think at

no eost of labour to hold and keep the
love of the kin whom nature gives you
would be wasting your pains as utterly
as one who should try‚' etc. Bentley
objected to this, (Ι) the involved order
of the words ‘natura quos tibi dat⁷inter-
rupting the construction of ‘nullo labore
retinere’ (a harshness hardly met by the
reference to Sat. 1. 5. 72 and 2. 1. 60.
Dillr. would get over the difficulty by
taking ‘nullo labore’ ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with
‘dat ' and ‘retinere‚' but this is beyond
Horace's use of that construction), (2)
the apparent contradiction of ‘nullo
la bore‚’ ‘ operam perdas.' How can
you waste your labour if you spend
none? (3) the want of correspondence
in the similitude ⁴ si quis asellum‚’ etc.
The difficulty in that ease lies with the
intractable nature of the materiah but
according to this interpretation the diffi-
culty in the thing to be illustrated lies
with the insufficient trouble of the
operator.

90. asellum currere. The Comm.
Cruq. vouches sor the existence of a
proverbial expression ‘docere asinum
currere,’ and it has been supposed to be
alluded to in Scipio⁷s jest on Ti. Clau-
dius Asellus, ‘agas asellum et cetera'
Cic. de Or. 2. 64. 258 with wilkins'
note.

9²· denique, ‘The sum of my an-
swer is.' It is intended to introduce
the last word on the general subjectos
hoarding, although the miser interrupts
with yet one more plea, so that there is
room (v. 106) for a second 'denique⁷:
but Horace is still specially answering
the argument that money would secure
attention in sickness. 'she futility of
