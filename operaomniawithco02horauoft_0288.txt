HORATII EPISTULARUM

Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister. 5
Si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,

Abicito potius quam quo perferre iuberis

Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum

Cognomen vertas in risum et fabula fias.

Viribus uteris per clivos, fiumina, lamas. ιο
Victor propositi simul ac perveneris illuc,

Sic positum servabis onus, ne sorte sub ala

Fasciculum portes librorum ut rusticus agnum,

Ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae,

5. sedulus: so ‘ sedulitas' Epp. 2. 1.
260. ‘ Opera vehemente’ and ‘sedulus
minister’ z ‘sedulo ministerio,' are
to be taken in close conjunction. They
add, under different grammatical forms,
two descriptions of the manner in which
the verb importes operates; ‘excessive
zeal ’ and ‘ officious service.'

6. uret: Epp. 1. 10. 43.

7. abicito, · fling it away on the
road rather than dash it down in ill-
temper at your journey's end‚' i. e. throw
up your commission at once rather than
discharge it unwillingly and awkwardly.

8. Asinae : see introd. and additional
note. The ass with Horace is always
the type of clownishness and ill-temper,
Sat. 1. 1. 90, 1. 9. 205 Epp. 1. 20.15,

2. 1. 199.

9. fabula fias: ‘fabula quanta fui’
Epod. 1 1. 8.

10. viribus uteris. ‘ There is a
place for energy; namt-ly, on the way;
when you corne into the presence what
is needed is grace and tact.' The figure
is still that of the ass.

lamas, ‘ pools‚' ‘ sloughs.’ ‘ Lacunas
maiores continentes aquam caelestem:
Ennius: Silvarum saltus latebras lamas-
que lutosas’ Acr. The word is noticed
by Festus s. v. ‘lacuna,’ but is other·
wise unknown in Latin.

11. vietor propositi, ‘ when you
have won your purpose.' Cp. ¹ voti
compos ' A. P. 76, and the Greek use of
ἐγκρατής with gen.

illue, ‘to your journey's end.’ It is
vaguely designated, as in v. 7 ⁶ quo per-
ferre iuberis.'

12. sic ne: A. P. 151, 152.

positum, usually taken, as by Orelli,
closely with servabis, as though it
were ‘sic pones et servabis,' as beginning
the description of the way in which the

books are to be held in the Emperor's
presence. if this were so it is hard to
see why the word ‘onus' should be
used, and changed immediately to ‘ fas-
ciculum libromm.’ Is it not better to
look on ‘ sic positum servabis onus' as
the words in which, addressing Vinius in
his proper person, he resumes, and
passes from, the preceding image, which
then wholly vanishes? We must not
have any suspicion of an ass carrying
a parcel ‘sub ala? ‘Sic’ goes with
‘servabis'2 ‘positum' is ‘laid aside.’
‘When you have landed your burden
your task is not done, you will then
keep charge of it, not in the awkward
way in which a man holds a parcel
when he doesn't quite know what to do
with it.’

13—15.ut . . . ut . . . ut. These
three illustrations (see on Epp. 1. 11.
11) are from familiar sights that have
moved to laughter in real life or on the
stage, but they seem to touch different
grounds of awkwardness—as though
what you carried was hard to h01d; as
though you were ashamed of it, trying
uselessly to hide it ; as though you were
yourself a clown going into company
above you.

14. glomus, ‘a ball of wool'3 see
Lach. and Munro on Lucr. on 1. 300.
The word occurs there with a long pen—
ultima. Bentley restored it to the text
here as against ⁶ glomos.’

Pyrrhia. According to the Scholiast
she was a character in a play of
Titinius. The form of the name is very
possibly corrupt, as Lachmann (on
Lucr. 6. 971) points out that it is not a
proper female name either in Greek or
Latin. The MSS. of Porph. have
‘ Purria‚' and K. and H. quote from an
inscription ‘Purreius ' as a Roman name.
