HORATII SATIRARUM

Non prius exacta tenui ratione saporum.

Nec satis est cara pisces averrere mensa

Ignarum quibus est ius aptius et quibus assis

Languidus in cubitum iam se conviva reponet.

Umber et iligna nutritus glande rotundas 40
Curvat aper lances carnem vitantis inertem;

Nam Laurens malus est, ulvis et arundine pinguis.

Vinea summittit capreas non semper edules.

Fecundae leporis sapiens sectabitur armos.

utmost importance to understand how
to flavour and how to dress.

35. arroget, potential‚ not hortative.

36. exacta,‘thoroughly studied) See
Conington on Virg. Aen. 4. 475 ‘teinpus
secum ipsa modumque Exigit?

tenui, ‘ subtle‚' ‘nice,' see on v. 9.

37. averrere. The verb describes
the indiscriminate purchase, taking
whatever there was, at whatever price.
Perhaps there is a sense of metaphor
from the sweepnet ‘ get-t-ifl-g4ev*e1·y kind ';
see on Sat. 2. 3. 235. ‘Averrere‘ was
the reading of V, and was interpreted
by Porph. ‘ abstrahere, auferre.⁷ Orelli
gives ‘ avertere ’ with some good MSS„
interpreting it ‘to appropriate to him-
self’ <as Virgil's ‘ avertere praedas ' Aen.
10. 78, etc).

mensa, the market—stall on which
the fish was exposed.

38. ignarum, with the subj. of ‘aver-
rere‚' ‘while ignorant what had better
be stewed and what broiled.’

ius, the sauce in which the stewed
fish was served. The edd. quote srom
Varro, R. R. 3. 9 the pun ‘ in ius vocat
pisces coquus?

quibus est. . .1·eponet: to be added
to the few cases such as Virg. Aen. 6.
614 ‘ ne quaere doceri. . . quae forma
viros fortunave mersit‚’ where the clas-
sical poets seem to adopt the ante-
classical usage of an indic. in indirect
questions. See Driigen Hist. Syntax 2.
p. 474, Madv. ξ 356, obs. 3.

assis: see on Sat. 2. 2. 51.
fish so dressed see Sat. 2. 8. 29.

39. in cubitum se reponet. Ritter
seems first to have urged that these
words should express the return to
a position of repose. Cp. ‘cubito re-
manete presso⁷ Od. 1. 27. 8. We are
to picture the guests (see Dict. Ant. s.v.
‘ triclinium') as leaning forward over the

For a

table with both arms free in eating, and
in the intervals resting on the left elbow.
The sentence then must mean ‘which
when broiled the guest will eat till he
is tired, and only then replace himself
on his elbow:' ‘quibus assis’ may be
taken as an abl. absol.. or directly with
‘languidus' The Scholiasts’ way of
taking it, still maintained by Schtitz,
Orelli, and others, is ‘for which when
broiled the tired guest (cp. ‘marcens
potor ’ of v. 58) will at once place him-
self again on his elbow.' They imagine,
that is, that he is lying back on the
cushion, and that he rouses himself
again for the appetizing dish. This is
excellent if the picture of his attitudes
is right.

40-43. ‘ As with fish, so with ga1ne;
think of the place it comes from, and so
of the food on which it has fattened—
a boar from the oak forests of Umbria,
not from the marshes of Laurentum:
the roe that has fed in vineyards is at
times less good eating.'

41. vitantis, after lances.

inertem. ⁵ flavourless.’

42. Laurens, Cp. Virg. Aen. 10.
708 ‘ aper, . . . quern . . . defendit . . .
palus Laurentia, silva pastus arundinea.'

43. summittit, ‘ supplies.'

44. fecundae: the reading of V,
rightly defended by Bentley against
‘fecundi,' which was an alteration due
to the fact that ‘lepus' is usually mas-
culine, but in this case the feminine
gender is appropriate. The line has
been best understood by Ritter. It is
another refinement of taste parallel to
that of the last line. The epithet ‘ fe-
cundae ' cannot be, as Orelli is content
to think, otiose. It must contain the
point. The Scholiasts no doubt ex-
plain it rightly ‘quia dicuntur semper
praegnantes esse lepores‚' with reference
