HORATII EPISTULARUM

Dividuo findetur munere quadra.

Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus, haberet 50
Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.

Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum,

Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,

Aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,

Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam, 55
Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis, uti mox

Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.

Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum, licet illi plurima manet

Lacrima, per sanctum iuratus dicat Osirim:

‘Credite non ludo3 crudeles, tollite claudum.'
‘Quaere peregrinum} vicinia rauca reclamat.

49. et mihi! Ι have followed K.
and H. and Schiitz in their punctu-
ation, which seems to have been that
of both Aer. and Porph. If the
whole line be made the cry of the second
beggar there is a difficulty in the future
tense, as there seems no point in the tone
of command (cp. Epp. Ι. 13. 2) which it
conveys. With our reading, the inter-
pretation of Aer. is substantially right,
‘dimidium accipiet, dum impudenter
petendo etiam alium ad eadem petitionem
accendit.’ ‘The gift will be divided
and you will get your share3 but you
might get more and that more pleasantly
if you didn’t ask.'

50. Possibly another reference (see
Sat. 2. 5. 56 with note) to the fable of
the Fox and the Raven, touching, as
there, only the single point that the
Raven by opening its mouth lost its
prize ; bnt itis possible also that Horace
has in view, or is inventing for the
occasion, a sable more completely ap-
posue.

52. Brundisium eomes, as Horace
himself, Sat. Ι. 5. As the port of em-
barkation sor Greece and the East it
would be a common object of expedi-
tions.

Surrentum. Sorrent0.at the southern
extremity of the Bay of Naples. In the
two following lines Horace touches the
minor annoyances of each of the two
journeys. For those of the road to
Brundisium, which involved crossing the
Appennincs, see Sat. 1. 5. 8011„ 95,

96. A traveller to Surrentum could
hardly eomplain of the road, but finds
other grievances in the pilfering of his
luggage.

55. refert, ‘is repeating! Porph.
refers to Plaut. Truc. 1. 1. 31, where a
lover complains of his mistress’s greed
and artifices.

catellam, ‘ catenulam‚' a little chain,
Liv. 29. 31. The same word is found
in Mart. 14. 198. 1 as a fem. dim. of
‘ catulus‚' a little puppy.

56. periscelidem, ‘ an anklet ⁸ ; ‘au-
reum cruris vinculum ’ Comm. Cruq.

59. planum. πλάνον, ‘a vagabond,’
or ‘an impostor’; the word is found
as naturalized even in prose Cic. Clu.
26. 72. ’

60. dieat: under the constr. of ‘licet‚'
repeated in thought.

Osirim. Compare the oath of the
perjurer in Juv. S. 13. 92 ‘Decernat
quodcunque volet de corpore nostro Isis,
et irato feriat mea lumina sistro.' The
superstitious at Rome affected foreign
and especially Egyptian cults, and such
an oath would be more impressive than
one of Roman habit. So Martial 8. 81.
1—4 ‘ Non per mystica sacra Dindymenes,
Nec per Niliacae bovem iuvencae, Nullos
denique per deos deasque Iurat Gellia:
sed per uniones.’

61. tollite: cp. the cry of the man
who has fallen into a pitfall, A. P.
4³62. quaere peregrinum. It seems,
from Quintilian 6. 3. 98, that there was
