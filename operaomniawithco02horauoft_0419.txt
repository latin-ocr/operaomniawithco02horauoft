HORATII ARS POETICA.

403

Nec reditum Diomedis ab interitu Meleagri,
Nec gemino bellurn Troianum orditur ab ovo:
Semper ad eventum festinat et in medias res
Non secus ac notas auditorem rapit, et quae

Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit;

Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,
Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.
Tu quid ego et populus mecum desideret audi:
Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque

Sessuri donec cantor ‘Vos plaudite' dicat,

146-150. ‘ Homer knows not only
[τοῖιν to begin, but where to begin. He
goes straight to the point and omits
tedious explanations.' Aristotle had
spoken of it as one of Homer's special
excellences, that he knows what to
omit: Ὀδύσσειαν γὰρ ποιῶν οὐκ ἐποίησεν
ἅπαντα ὅσα αὐτῷ συνέβη, οἷον πληγῆναι
μὲν ἐν τῷ Παρνασσῷ, μανῆναι δὲ προσ-
ποιήσασθαι ἐν τῷ ἀγερμῷ ὧν οὐδὲν θα-
τέρου ’γενομένου ἀναγκαῖον ἧν ἢ εἰκὸς
θάτερον γενέσθαι, ἀλλὰ περὶ μίαν πρᾶξιν
οἵαν λέγοιμεν τὴν Ὀδύσσειαν συνέστη-
σεν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὴν Ἰλιάδα Poet. 8. 3.

146. neo . . . neo. ‘He no more be-
gins a Diomedeia (i. e. would do so if
he wrote one—a general statement of
the practice he avoids put in particular
terms which hit some one else) . . . than
he (actually) begins his Iliad, etc.’ The
return of the different heroes from Troy
was the subject of several Cyelie poenis,
Νοστοί. Meleager, the unhappy son of
Atalanta, was the half brother of Tydeus,
Diomede's father.

147. gemino ovo, i. e. from the birth
of Helen. For another allusion to the
legend of the two eggs cp. Sat. 2. 1. 26.

148. ad eventum festinat, ‘he is
hastening to the issue ’-καταστροφὴν-
he has no leisure tor irrelevant details.

in medias reS. The Homeric man-
ner became proverbial. Cic. ad Att. 1.
16. 1 ‘Respondebo tibi ὕστερον πρότερον,
Ὁμηρικῶς, Quintil. 7. 10. 11 ‘ ubi ab
initiis incipiendum, ubi more Homerico
e mediis vel ultimis.'

151. ita . . . sio . . . ne, ‘with this
reservation,' as often in prose; so inf.
v. 225. ‘While he gives his imagina-
tion full play, never forgets that funda-
mental rule of symmetry with which
we started '—so we come back to the
doctrine ofvv. 1-23. Horace claims the
privilege (v. 10) ‘ quidlibet audendi,' but

155

with the limit there laid down. The
passage usually quoted from Arist. Poet.
24. 9 δεδίδαχε δὲ μάλιστα καὶ τοὺς ἅλ-
λους ψευδῆ Λέγειν ὡς δεῖ is not relevant.
As Hermann explains, he is speaking
there not of the poet's invention, but of
deception practised by one character in
a poem on another, as, in the instance
cited srom Odyss. 19, by Ulysses and
Penelope.

153. V. 152 has designedly repeated
the principle which has never been quite
out of sight in the first portion of the
poem. The emphatic ‘Tn‚ quid ego
. . . audi ³ is meant to indicate the pas-
sage to a second part, more persona]
and particular, in which Horace lays
down sor Piso's special benefit some
rules sor success in drama.

ego et populus mecum : rules which
will secure the approval both of the
competent critic and of the less com-
petent crowd.

154. plausoris: Epp. 2. 2. 130.

aulaea manentis, ‘waiting out the
curtain ' must mean waiting till the enr-
tain rises (see Epp. 2. 1. 189 n.) at the
end of the piece.

155. cantor.
some equivalent words) are found at the
end of every complete play of Plautus
and Terence, and the practice is fre-
quently alluded to in Latin writers as pre·
vailing both in comedy and in tragedy
iQuintil. 6. 1. 525. Ἃ ho spoke them,
is a disputed point. Bentley (on Ter.
Andr. 5. 6. 17) held that the ‘cantor‘
named here was the flute-player who
had accompanied the ‘cantica’ Her-
mann (Opusc. 1. 302) controverted this,
thinking that ‘cantor’ was the same as
‘histrio‚' an actor. Prof. Wilkins on
this passage shows that the passages os
Cicero on which Hermann relied do not
prove his point.
