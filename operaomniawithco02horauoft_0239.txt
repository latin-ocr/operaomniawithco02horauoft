the ἀριθμός, πρόβατ’ ἄλλως, ἀμφορῆς
νενησμένοι of Arist. Nub. 1203, where
the succeeding (lesignations explain the
first: men without indivicluality, who
can only be spoken ofin the mass.

fruges consumere nati, ‘ fit for no
task higher than to eat their share of
earth's f1·uits’; an adaptation of the
Homeric βροτῶν οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν
ἔδουσιν. For ‘nati’ with the inf, see
App. 2 of vol. 1. ξ 2.

28. sponsi. Cp. Virgil's ‘nulli
quondam flexere mariti’ of Dido's
suitors, Aen. 4. 35.

nebulones: see on Sat. Ι. 1. 104.
It is a further designation of ‘sponsi,'
giving the application by a familiar
phrase of Roman town lise, answering
to the description of ‘Alcinoi iuventus,'
‘ good-for-naught suitors of Penelope.'

Alcinoi iuventus, the young cour-
11615 of Alcinous, as he describes them
in Odyss. S. 248 αιέὶ δ’ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη
κίθαρίς τε χοροί τε l εἵματά τ’ ἐξημοιβὰ
λοετρά τε θερμὰ καῖ εὐναί. Cp. Epp. 1.
15. 24 ‘ Pinguis ut inde domurn possim
Phaeaxque reverti!

29. cute curanda: Epp. 1. 4. 15
‘bene curata cute,' Sat. 2. 5. 38 ‘ pelli-
culam curare'5 ‘in keeping their skin
sleek.’

30. in medios dormire dies. This
belongs to the life of a lazy young
Roman (cp. Pers. Sat. 3 passim), not the
actual Homeric picture.

31. †cessatum ducere curam. So
editors usually print. even those who,
as Munro, do not believe Horace to
have written it. If we accept it, it will
probably mean ‘to beguile care into
stopping.' Any objection to the phrase
itself is not to the supine after ‘ ducere‚’
which is abundantly supported by Sat.
2. 4. 89 ‘auditum ducere,’ but to the
fancisul character of the expression,
which has nothing in Homer to account
for it. and is unlike Horace's style.
But although the majority of the older
MSS. give this reading, all Cruquius‘
Blanrlinian MSS. had ‘ somnum ' instead
of ¹ cu1·am‚' and this Keller considers the

reading generally of his ‘ second class ¹
of MSS. The scholium of Acr. in its
later part explains ‘ cessatum curam‚' but
Bentley argues that 1116 first annotation‚
‘quia adhibemus sonitum citharae ac
lyrae ut facilius sopiamur' belongs to
an earlier reading of ‘somnmn' The
Bland. MSS. seem to have had ‘ cessa·
tum,' which with ‘somnum' has no
meaning, and so have the other MSS.
Bentley, building in part on the reading
of some early editions · cessantum‚' pro—
posed to complete the sense by altering
‘cessatum' to ‘cessantem' and he is
followed by Haupt, Meineke, and otherS.
Munro (Journ. of Philology, vol. 9.
p. 217) proposes ‘recreatum' ‘to pro-
long sleep restored at the sound of the
lyre.' Bentley takes ‘ cessantem ' in the
same sense as Od. 3. 28. 8 ‘cessantem
amphoram‚' ‘to tempt sleep when it is
coy.' The parallel will be Od. 3. 1. 20
‘ Non avium citharaeque cantus Somnum
reducent.' 'l he problem can hardly be
said to be solved: but there is great
force in Bentley's argument that the
context both before and after is in
favour of some reading which makes
sense of ‘somnunr’ The young Phaea-
cians are not painted as burdened with
care Which needs beguiling, and we need
to emphasize in every way, and to end
with, the charge of excessive sleep, as it
is the text of the moral lecture which
follows, With ‘ curam ’ the connection
of 32 foll. is harsh.

32. hominem. Orelli follows afew
MSS. in reading ‘homines’ Keller
shows that, besides the great preponder-
ance of authority, the usual phrase for
‘ murder ⁷ was ‘hominem occidere,' as in
Epp. 1. 16. 48.

de noete, ‘while it is still night?
See on ‘de die ' Epod. 13. 4.

33. te ipsum. We must not sup-
pose these lessons to be pressed home
directly to Lollius. As in thehlast
Epistle, Horace addresses an imaginary
person, some young ‘ Phaeacian’ of
Roman society.
