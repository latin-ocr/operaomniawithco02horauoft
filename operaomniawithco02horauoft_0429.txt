HORATII ARS POETICA.

413

Ausus idern: tantum series iuncturaque pollet,
Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris.
Silvis deducti caveant me iudice Fauni,

Ne velut innati triviis ac paene forenses

245

Aut nimium teneris iuvenentur versibus unquam,
Aut immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta;
Offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et res,
Nee, si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emptor,

Aequis accipiunt animis donantve corona.

250

Syllaba longa brevi subiecta vocatur iambus,
Pes citus3 unde etiam trimetris accrescere iussit

Enraptured thinks to do the thing at

onee3

But after inky thumbs and bitten

nails,

And twenty scattered quires, the cox-

comb l'ailsff
For a similar description of the ‘ars
celandi artein' cp. Epp. 2. 2. 124.

242. series iuncturaque: vv. 46,
48 ‘in verbis serendis . . . innctura.’
Here the power of making what is old
new by its setting, is claimed in relation
to the plot as there to the language.

243. de medio sumptis, ‘the com-
monest materials.’ The sentiment is
general. Cicero (Or. 49. 163) uses the
phrase of ordinary diction as opposed
to that of the poet ‘exquisita ad sonum.'

244. deducti, se. ‘in scenam.'

Fauni: see on Epp. 1. 19. 4. Horace
is speaking (as Ritter explains, see
above on v. 240) of the Chorus of Satyrs,
thus completing the account of the
Satyric drama, as he completed that of
Tragedy by treating of the Tragic
Chorus3 and he is speaking, not of their
diction, but of their sentiments. They
are the wild children of the woods, and
(though, perhaps it is implied‚ a coarse—
ness of their own is not out of place)
they must not be credited with town
vices ⁴whether of softness or coarse vul-
garity.

245. forenses, sc. dwellers in the
heart of the town; with a depreciatory
sense, as Livy's ‘ forensis factio ’ 9. 46.
13: cp. ἀγοραῖος.

246. teneris versibus. Yonge re-
calls Hotspur’s ‘ mincing poetry.’

iuvenentur : ἅπαξ λε’γ., and possibly
invented by Horace after the analogy of
νεανιεύεσθαι, ‘ to talk as young men do.'

247. crepent: see on Od. 1. 18. 5,
Sat. 2. 3. 33.

«fieta, ‘ jests.'

248. quibus est equus. se. ‘equites'
Sat. Ι. Ιο. 76, Epp. 2. Ι. 183, and supr.
v. 113.

pater : those who are said ‘to have a
father ’ are ‘ ingenui': see on Epp. Ι. 7.

4249. ciceris, nucis stand for the
cheapest food. For ‘ ciceris' see Sat. 1.
6. 115 and 2. 3. 183, where with ‘fabae ²
and ‘lupini' it is named as given in
largesse to gain the votes of the poorer
people. fricti goes with both subst.‚
‘frictas nuces’ Plaut. Poen. 1. 2. 111 ε
‘ nuces‚’ as Orelli sayS‚ includes chest-
nuts.

250. corona‚1netaphorical: ep. Epp.
2. 2. 96.

251—269. The purport of this passage
is to criticize the laxity of Roman prac-
tice in respect of the metre of Tragedy,
mainly the Iambic, and to urge the
closer study of Greek models. The tone
is playsul‚ both in the prosaic gravity of
the opening statement, as though from
a school ‘Prosody‚' and in the subse-
quent personilication of the Iambus as a
proprietor easy to encroaching neigh-
bours.

252. pes citus. The lightness of the
measure is the point to be emphasized, as
‘the characteristic which the elder Latin
poets failed to understand and repro—
duce : the Scholiasts therefore are right
in making ‘unde etiam ' depend on ‘pes
citus.' ‘ The lightness of the “iambus '’
was felt so strongly that the Iambic
senarius was called [not‚ as in the dac-
tylic metre, an “hexameter‚'’ but] a tri-
meter.’ ‘Cum,⁷h0wever‚ is not‘although,'
