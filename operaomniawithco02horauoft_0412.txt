HORATII ARS POETICA.

Terra Neptunus classes aquilonibus arcet,

Regis opus, sterilisve diu palus aptaque remis 65
Vicinas urbes alit et grave sentit aratrum,

Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis

Doctus iter melius, mortalia facta peribunt,

Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.

Multa renascentur quae iam cecidere, cadentque 70
Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,

Quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi.

Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella

Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.

Versibus impariter iunctis querimonia primum, 75
Post etiam inclusa est voti sententia compos:

carried out, which they have not been ἐ
and the force of the illustration is greatly
diminished by being reduced from an
achievement to an unrealized intention.

65. regis opus. Schiitz suggests
that Horace has in mind ‘the great
king,' and what the Romans looked
upon as his half fabulous enterprises;
the caual behind Mount Athos, and the
bridging the Hellespont (Juv. S. 10.
173 s.). He notices that Ausonius
(Mosell. 287) uses of these exploits of
Xerxes the expression ‘ Regis opus
magnil'

diu palus. This is the reading of
all the MSS, and is attested by Servius
on Aen. 2. 69 and 4. 107, and by Pris-
cian 6. 16. 83, who comment on the
unusual quantity. We must imagine
therefore, at least, a very early corrup-
tion. Holder gave ‘palus diu‘ and spoke
of it as an emendation of Gesner ap-
proved by Lachmann, but Ι cannot
verify this. It was suggested indepen-
dently by Bp. Chr. VVordsworth. Keller
has returned in his Epilegomena to the
Vulg.‚ thinking the hiatus impermissible.
Munro says ‘ “ diu palus '⁷ can hardly be
right,' but cannot accept ‘ palus diu ' nor
Bentley's ⁴ palus prius.'

68. doctus iter melius. Cp. Epp.
1. 14. 29, of the stream by his own
farm, ‘ multa mole docendus aprico par-
cere prato?

69. sermonum, ‘ language’; the plur.,
which is unusual in this sense, seems
due to the antithesis to ‘facta ' ; ‘what
they say' opp. to ‘ what they do.’

71. usus: Epp. 2. 2. 119.

73 f. Horace is passing from words

to diction in the larger sense of style;
and the first principle to be laid down
is that each kind of poetry has its ap-
propriate style. The kinds of poetry
are marked by the metres. The point
of transition lies in the contrast between
the dependence on sashion varying from
age to age, which he has attributed to
words, the fixity of metres‚ i. e. accord-
ing to his view, of the types of poetry,
as settled once for all by the first masters
in each style.

74. numero, ‘ metre': cp. ‘ numeris ’
in Od. 4. 2. 11.

75. impariter, an ἅπαξ λεγ., ‘verses
unequally yoked,’ describes the metre of
Elegy as consisting of couplets, but of
couplets of long and short.

76. voti sententia compos, ‘the
sense of granted prayer': the position
of the man who feels the sentiment is
attributed to the sentiment. This is
generally explained (as by Orelli) of
the elegy of love (ἐρωτική), as contrasted
with that of mourning (θρηνητική). But
amatory poetry is not all of ‘granted
prayers’; and in truth love is lest as a
subject to lyric poetry (v. 85). Horace
is thinking rather of the elegiae couplet
as the metre of inscriptions, ‘exigui
elegi‚' whether on funeral urns or on
votive offerings. The immediate purpose,
however, is perhaps not so much to
explain the subject of elegy-writing
as to connect the popular derivation
of the word from ἒ λέγειν with the
eheersul tone of much actual elegiae
verse; ‘the complaint [of those that
have lost] and the [joyful] feelings of
those who have gained their wish)
