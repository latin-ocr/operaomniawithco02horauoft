HORATII EPISTULARUM

Si soret in terris, rideret Democritus, seu

Diversum confusa genus panthera camelo,

195

Sive elephas albus volgi converteret ora3
Spectaret populum ludis attentius ipsis,

Ut sibi praebentem nimio spectacula plura3
Scriptores autem narrare putaret asello

Fabellam surdo.

Nam quae pervincere voces

Evaluere sonum referunt quem nostra theatra?
Garganum mugire putes nemus aut mare Tuscum,
Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur et artes,

Divitiaeque peregrinae, quibus oblitus actor
Cum stetit in scena, concurrit dextera laevae.
Dixit adhuc aliquid? Nil sane.
Lana Tarentino violas imitata veneno.

Ac ne forte putes me, quae facere ipse recusem,
Cum recte tractent alii, laudare maligne;

features of a triumph, and Livy 37. 59
speaks of Scipio Asiaticus as having so
exhibited the ⁵ simulacra ⁷ of 134 towns.
Corinth would be named typically as re-
ealling the richest of Roman triumphs.
The Scholiasts offer both explanations.

194. Democritus, the laughing
philosopher; see on Epp. 1. 12. 12,
A. P. 297. Cp. Juv. S. 10. 28, where he
is imagined as laughing at the fantastie
pomp of the praetor's train at the games.

195. diversum genus may be the
nom. in apposition, or an acc. con-
stmcted as in Virgil's ‘ Delphinum
caudas utero commissa luporum’ Aen.
3. 428. A camelopard, according to
Pliny, N. H. 8. 18. 27, was first seen at
Rome in the ‘ludi circenses' given by
Julius Caesar.

198. nimio : with plura, ‘very much
more,' i. e. than the games. It is diffi-
cult choosing between this reading, and
‘ mimo 'z‘ histrionibus.' ‘ Nimio ² was
read in V, and has the support of Keller's
class I and ΙΙ. ‘ Mimo ' <which Orelli
and Ritter defend) is found in his class
ΙΙΙ, and was read by Porph. [If ‘ nimio’
is right it settles the question discussed
on Od. 1. 18. 15 in favour of taking
‘nimio’ there and in similar cases as
the abl. of measure; for here the com-
parative abl. to be understood is clearly
‘ludis,’ and ‘nimio' can only be the
abl. of measure]

199. ‘ He would think those who take

Quid placet ergo?

the trouble to write plays fools sor their
ains.’

p asello surdo. Lambinus remarked
that Horace has put together two pro-
verbial expressions for wasted labour,

2. 1. 10) and to ‘ speak to an ass,' ὄνῳ
τις ἔλεγε μῦθον· ὁ δὲ τὰ ὦτα ἐκίνει.

201. evaluere: Virg. Aen. 7. 756.
The preposition expresses the efsort re-
quired. For the noises of the audience
cp. A. P. 81.

202. Garganum nemus: Od. 2. 9. 7
‘ querceta Gargani?

203. artes, ‘ works osart': Od. 4. 8. 5.

204. oblitus, *bedizened' : there is a
sting in the word, as though the orna-
ments were laid on with too coarse a
hand.

206. nil sane, ‘ absolutely nothing ’ :
Sat. 2. 3. 138.

207. veneno, ‘ dye '; Virg. G. 2. 265 ;
see on Od. 3. 5. 28. The purple dye of
Tarentum is praised by Pliny, N. H. 9.

208-210. ne forte putes . . . ille,
etc., ¹ for sear you should think . . . let
me say that he? etc. A Lucretian for-
mula (NLucr. 2. 844, 4. 129) ; cp. Od. 1.
33.1 n.; Epp.1.1. 13, 1.19. 26.

recusem. The word suggestS‚ but
does not prove, that Horace had been
pressed to write for the stage.

209. maligne, ‘grudgingly’; so as
to ‘ damn with saint praise.'
