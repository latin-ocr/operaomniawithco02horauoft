HORATII ARS POETICA.

399

Humani voltus: si vis me flere, dolendum est
Primum ipsi tibi: tunc tua me infortunia laedent,
Telephe vel Peleu3 male si mandata loqueris

Aut dormitabo aut ridebo.

Tristia maestum

105

Voltum verba decent, iratum plena minarum,
Ludentem lasciva, severum seria dictu.

Format enim natura prius nos intus ad omnem
Fortunarum habitum3 iuvat aut impellit ad iram

Aut ad humum maerore gravi deducit et angit3

110

Post effert animi motus interprete lingua.

Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta
Romani tollent equites peditesque cachinnum.
Intererit multum divusne loquatur an heros,

Maturusne senex an adhuc florente iuventa

115

FerviduS‚ et matrona potens an sedula nutrIX,

Mercatorne vagus cultorne virentis agelli,
Colchus an Assyrius, Thebis nutritus an Argis,
Aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge.

102. humani: emphatic ; faces, which
are the faces of men, and therefore
have human feelings behind them z
‘ mentem mortalia tangunt.'

104. male, with mandata. ‘If the
language put into your mouth is badly
conceived,' i. e. if it does not suit the
situation and the outward bearing
(σχῆμα Α1151. Ρο01. 17. 1. 25 of the
actor. Lambinus took ‘ male' with
‘loqueris‚' bnt, as Orelli points out,
Horace is talking of faults in the eom-
positi0n‚ not in the aeting. For ‘ man-
data' see inf. v. 176.

108 f. The order ofnature is first the
feeling, whatsoever it be, that outward
things call up—then the expression in
words. It must be the same with the
poet in drawing his characters and as-
signing speeches to them.

109. iuvat, ‘ gives pleasure t0.'

113. equites peditesque, 10. the
whole audience— high and low. The
phrase is proverbial, from the old mili-
tary elassificati(·n ‘ omnes cives Romani
equites peditesque ' Liv. 1. 44. Not to
be pressed literally here, at the same
time it is suggested by the fact that the
‘ equites' were actually distinguished
by their place in the theatre, and stand
with Horace for the more educated part
of the audience, Sat. 1. 10. 76, Epp. 2.

1. 187, and inf. v. 248. For a similar
adaptation of the old classification of
the citizens cp. v. 341 ‘ Centuriae seni-
orum,' etc.

114 f. The varying ‘fortunarum habi-
tus’ are enumerated.

114. divusne‚ ‘a god or a demi-god.'
Some few MSS have ‘ Davusne? and
Porphyrion's schol. shows signs of this
reading, but it would not match the
other contrasted pairs. The false read-
ing arose from a reminiscence of v. 237.

115. maturus: Od. 4. 4. 55 ‘matur-
osque patres.’

116. matrona potens: ‘the matron
of authority' is eontrasted with the
nurse full of petty anxieties and atten-
tions‚ a favourite stage character. Juvenal
has ‘ matrona potens’ (1. 69), perhaps
with satirical reference to this place.

117. For the contrast cp. Od. 1. 1.
11-18.

118. ‘Remember there are distinc-
tions even between two barbarians or
two Greeks.' Thebes and Argos are
chosen as the representative states be-
cause of the plays which bring them
into contrast, such as the Sept. c.
Thebas, but there is no definite reference
to actual characters.
