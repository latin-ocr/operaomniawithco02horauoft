LIB. Ι. EPIST. 17. 299 ,

EPISTLE XVII.

TO SCAEVA.

Verses 1—5. YOU do not need the advice of such a humble and incxpericnced
person as Ι am as to the way to live with the great, but take it for what it is
worth.

6—12. If it be true that quiet and freedom are what you care sor, the question will
not arise—you will give up ¹ society’ once and for all. There is something
to be said for that course ; but if you have hungry relations and like a good
dinner yomself, it is natural to make up to the great. Nor is that wrong.

13-17. The Cynic gibes at the Cyrenaic ; but the Cyrenaic has his answer.

17—32. Neither is wholly independent‚ but the view of Diogenes is the narrower
and least practieal of the two.

33-36. The great glories of life are for the chosen few. To win the favour of
these chiefs of mankind is another grade of distinction, and it is not sor every-
one any more than the first.

57—42. Some are deterred from trying by sear of failure. But here, as elsewhere, it
is not true virtue (i. e. manliness) to give up for want oftrying. Only remember,
when you have found your patron, two golden rules.

43—51. 1. Never ask 3 you will get more and rouse less envy.

52—62. 2. Never grumble ; your real troubles will gain more credence if you have
not bored people with trifling ones.

Porph. treats Epp. 17 and 18 as one continuous Epistle‚ and all the Scholiasts
make Scaeva and Lollius the same person. Both are evidently mistakes, but they
mean that the early critics perceived that the two Epistles were meant to be read
in close connection with each other. They deal with one subject, the reverse of that
treated in Epp. 1. 7. T hat spoke of the relation of a patron to his protegi—these
of the relation of the protdge‘ to his patron. When the two Epistles are taken to-
gether they deal pretty fully with the subject. We see the matter from the patron's
side, the greed and pushing of one dependent, the servility of another, the clumsy
attempts of a third to assert independence by being rude and disobliging. We see
also the natural shrinking of many men from a questionable and difficult position.
We read between the lines Horace's advice on the whole about it: ‘ Keep out of it
if you can—bear yourself naturally and with selsrespect while you are in it. Re-
member the higher ends and pleasures of life, and be content (as I have been) to
make your escape early into a modest competence.'

But there are great differences between the two Epistles. The spirit of Ep. 17
seems at least half satirical. The humility of the beginning from such a master in
the art of pleasing the great (Ep. 1. 20. 29) is overdone sor complete seriousness ; the
motives suggested in vv. 11, 12 are too broadly put, the tone of ‘aut virtusn omen
inane est ⁷ (v. 41) recalls too nearly the irony of Ep. 6 ; the two golden rules which
end the Epistle, as though they contained the whole art of which v. 2 promised to
speak, are too like an intentional bathos.

Scaeva is an unknown person. Is he a young man with whom Horace is on
friendly terms and in whose particular case the apparent satire has a playful turn
beyond our guessing? Or is he a shadow? Is it really a Satire under the form
