HORATII EPISTULARUM

Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit, 10
Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.

Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

Cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox3
Cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri

Nil parvum sapias et adhuc sublimia cures: 15
Quae mare compescant causae, quid temperet annum,
Stellae sponte sua iussaene vagentur et errent,

Quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat orbem,

fluat‘ Epod. 15. 20) which ‘culta . . .
irrigat auro’ Virg. Aen. 10. 142. ‘ In—
auro' is used figuratively of a person in
Cic. ad Fam. 7. 13. 1 ‘ te malle a
Caesare consuli quam inaurari.⁷

10. vel. . .vel. Iccius may take his
choice between the reasons. Both apply
to him. His simplicity of taste belongs
both to his nature and to his ideal of
life.

naturam : a man's nature. Cp.
Epod. 4. 6 ‘Fortuna non mutat
genus.7

11. una: Epp. 1. 7. 30; contrasted
with ‘cuncta' Everything else in one
scale, virtue in the other.

1 2—14 foll. miramur . . . cum tu‚‘we
marvel. . . and that though you‚’ etc.
Iccius is a greater marvel than Demo-
critus The latter lost himself to his
own concertis in his philosophieal
dreaming. The former has kept all his
philosophical interest though immersed
in business and its temptations. Demo-
critus. the Eleatic philosopher, ofAbdera.
Epp. 2. 1. 194, A. P. 297. He is in
Cicero a stock instance of absorption in
philosophy, de Fin. 5. 29. 87 ‘ ut quam
minime animus a cogitationibus abdu-
ceretur patrimonium neglexit, agros
deseruit incultos.' Cp. D. Tusc. 5. 39.
114, 115.

13. peregre est, ‘is on its travels.'
Cp. Od. 1. 28. 5 ‘ animoque rotundum
Percurrisse polum,’ and Plato's picture
(Theaetet. p. 173 E.) of the philosopher
whose body only ἐν τῇ πόλει κεῖναι καῖ
ἐπιδημεῖ, ἡ δὲ διάνοια , . . πανταχῇ φέρε·
Ταί.

velox: of the swiftness of thought3
cp. Od. 3. 25. 3.

14. scabiem et contagia, as the
Comm. Cruq. says=‘seabiem conta-
giosam ’; lucri goes with the two
subst. together. Cicero uses ‘scabies’

of the easily excited desire of pleasure.
Legg. 1. 17. 47. ‘Among so many
itching palms.’

15. nil parvum sapias. Itis diffi-
cult to find an exact parallel for this
use. Is it ‘act the “sapiens‚'' philo-
sophize, on losty themes,’ a coloured
synonym for ‘cogites' with reference
to the uses of φρονεῖν, ἐπινοεῖν, etc?
Or can it mean ¹ have no mean tastes ¹? ’
There are uses that come near this. Cp.
A. P. 212 ‘ Indoctus quid enim saperet !'
and Cicero's play on the word ‘ cui cor
sapiat, ei non sapiat palatum' Fin. 2. 8.
24. For ‘nil parvum ⁷ cp. Od. 2. 25. 17.

adhuc: ‘as you did in old days.’
Cp. Od. 1. 29, introd. and vv. 13, 14.

sublimia cures: not without refer-
ence to the phrase used seriously as well
as injest of Greek physical philosopher5‚
τὰ μετέωρα φροντίζειν. See Riddell
on Plat. Apol. 18 Β. With the physieal
problems which follow cp. Virg. G. 2.
475 foll„ Prop. 3. 5. 25 foll.

16. quae mare compescant causae.
Virg. l. c. v. 479 ‘ qua vi maria alta
tumescant Obicibus ruptis rursusque in
se ipsa residant.’

temperet: Od. 1. 12. 15.

17. sponte sua iussaene. A poetical
statement (resembling that in Od. 1. 34)
of the question at issue between the
Stoics and Epicuream, as to the presence
or absence of Divine Wiu as a factor in
the universe.

vagentur et errent: this combina-
tion is common in Cicero in the sense of
‘wandering at large’ ; cp. de Or. 1. 48.
209 ‘ne vagari et errare cogatur oratio,’
Acad. Prior. 2. 20. 66 ‘eo fit ut eorum
et vagar latius,’ and in the same con-
nection as this rof the planets) de Rep.
1. 14. 22 ‘stellarum quae errantes et
quasi vagae nominarentur.'

18. obscurum, predicatively with
