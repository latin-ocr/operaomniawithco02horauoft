HORATII SATIRARUM

100

E xoratns, ut esset opem qui ferre poetis

Α ntiquz's posset contra fastidia nostra,

Grmmnalz'corum equilum doctissimus. Ut redeam illuc .·]
Nempe incomposito dixi pede currere versus

Lucili. Quis tam Lucili fautor inepte est

Ut non hoc fateatur? At idem quod sale multo

Urbem defricuit charta laudatur eadem.

Nec tamen hoc tribuens dederim quoque cetera: nam sic 5
Et Laberi mimos ut pulchra poemata mirer.

Ergo non satis est risu diducere rictum .
Auditoris: et est quaedam tamen hic quoque virtus:

Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia, neu se

¹Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures; 10
Et sermone opus est modo tristi, saepe iocoso,

Defendente vicem modo rhetoris atque poetae,

Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus atque

Extenuantis eas consulto.

Ridiculum acri

Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res. ¹5

6. exoratus: sub. ‘est.' Other MSS.
have ⁴ exhortatus‚' which would be used
passively.

8. ut redeam illue: suggested by
Sat. 1. 1. 108 ‘Illuc unde abii redeo‘;
but it is harsher here]

Ι. nempe .. . dixi, ‘it is true I said.’
We are to imagine ourselves as over-
hearing part of a conversation. Horace
is replying to criticism on what he had
said in Sat. 1. 4.

incomposito . . . pede: cp. ‘ pede
certo’ Sat. 1. 4. 47; ‘halting rhythm.'
There is possibly some sense of con-
tinuity in the metaphor ‘pede currere.'
What he had actually said was that
Lucilius was ‘ durus componere versus ¹
Sat. 1. 4. 8.

3. sale multo . . . defricuit. The
general sense is imitated by Pers. 1. 114
‘secuit Lucilius urbem.’ The Schol.
is probably right in taking it as a con-
tinuous metaphor. His wit was the
salt which made the sore places smalt.
The praise which Horace elaims to
have given to Lucilius must be looked
for in the whole passage, vv. 1—8 of Sat.
1. 4.

4. charta. Sat. 1. 5. 104. The sing.
is used of a single poem.

5. cetera, every other good quality,
including smooth versification.

6. et Laberi mimos, which contain,
like Lucilius' satires, plenty of well-ap-
plied wit. Laberius is the Roman knight
whom Caesar compelled to act his own
mimes. The prologue which he spoke
on the occasion is given, with the story.
in Macrob. Satum. 2. 7, and has great
spirit3 but Cicero is at one with Horace
in speaking slightingly of the mimes
themselves, ad Fam. 12. 18 ‘equidem
sie iam obdurui ut ludis Caesaris nostri
animo aequissimo . . . audirem Laberii
et Publii poemata.'

9. brevitate: whereas Lucilius was
‘garrulus‘; ‘erat quod tollere velles ’;
Sat. 1. 4. 11, 12.

11. tristi, ‘ serious.'

12. defendente, ‘ maintaining‚' as
A. P. 194 ⁴ partes officiumque defendat?
It is a variation of the common ‘tueri
personam,' ‘tueri rnunus,’ etc.

vicem, as ‘fungar vice' A. P. 304,
‘place‚’ ‘ part.’

rhetoris, one who composes declam-
ations.

13. parcentis viribus, a description
of irony.

15. plerumque, as usually in Ho-
race, ‘ very often.' Sat. 2. 5. 553 Epp.
1. 18. 94, 2. 2. 84; A. P. 14, 95.

secat, ‘decides,' ‘cuts the knots!
Epp. 1. 16. 42 ‘multae magnaeque se-
