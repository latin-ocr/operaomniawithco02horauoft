HORATII EPISTULARUM

Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum;
Ac non verba sequi fidibus modulanda Latinis,
Sed verae numerosque modosque ediscere vitae.

Quocirca mecum loquor haec tacitusque recordor:

145

Si tibi nulla sitim finiret copia lymphae,
Narrares medicis; quod quanto plura parasti
Tanto plura cupis, nulline faterier audes?
Si volnus tibi monstrata radice vel herba

Non fieret levius, fugeres radice vel herba
Audieras, cui

Proficiente nihi] curarier.

150

Rem di donarent illi decedere pravam
Stultitiam; et cum sis nihilo sapientior ex quo
Plenior es, tamen uteris monitoribus isdem?

At si divitiae prudentem reddere possent,

laws of poetry, but to fling away poetry
with all other modes of triffing, and set
to the serious business of life.⁷

nugis: Epp. 1. 1. 10 ‘versus et ce-
tera ludicra?

142. pueris, dat. both with ‘ tempes-
tivum' and ⁴ concedere'3 to leave 10
boys the play that is seasonable for
them '; a good instance of the so-called
ἀπὸ κοινοῦ construction3 see on Od. Ι.

143. ac non: Sat. 2. 3. 135 11., Epp.
1.10. 6.

verga sequi. Orelli compares Plat.
Gorg. 489 Β ὀνόματα θηρεύειν; cp. A.
P. 240 ¹ ex noto fictum carmen sequar' z
with ‘verba fidibus modulanda': cp.
Od. 4. 9. 4 ‘ verba . . . socianda chordis‚'
but ‘fidibus' is here the abl. of the
instr. by which the words are to be set in
rhythm.

144. numerosque modosque: see
on Epp. 1. 18. 59.

145. mecum loquor . . . recordor.
The figure is that of ‘ediscere' con-
tinued. He would ‘ get by heart ' the
methods of reducing lise to time and
tune. To that end, if Florus were to
come and see him, he would hear him
‘saying over to hiniself‚’ not tags of
verse in the making, but what he can
remember of the commonplaces of his
philosophical teachers. This is the
description of the remainder of the
Epistle. It is Horace’s way of tall-:ing to
himself, a sermon to Florus only at
secondhand.

The maxims and arguments which
he reealls are the ‘ elementa ' of Epp. 1.
1. 27, the 51016 of rudimentary philo-
sophy which he there represents himself
as accumulating for his own use. Ava-
rice is as usual (see Sat. 1. Ι) 1116 typical
vice first attacked.

146. tibi, not Florus: see the last
note.

147. medicis. The argument from
analogy between the medicine of the
body and of the soul is frequent: see
Ep. 1. 1. 33 foll. Cp. the hint of
Florus' own ailments in Epp. 1. 3. 26.
For the solly of not dealing with first
symptoms and being frank with your
doctor see Epp. 1. 2. 33 f., 1. 16. 21 f.
For the special comparison of avarice
to the dropsy cp. Od. 2. 2. 13 f.

148. faterier. For the form 566 on
Sat. 2. 3. 24.

149. monstrata, ‘ prescribed,' a tech-
nical word of medicine; see Mayor on
Juv. S. 10. 363.

151. eurarier : to be further treated ;
for the form see above v. 148.

audieras: suppose you had heard.
For the tense and mood cp. Sat. 2.6. 48
⁶ spectaverat,' ‘ luserat.' Orelli explains
‘a volg0’; it is the world's teaching
that, wealth once attained, desire will
moderate and virtue be easy; the philo·
sopher knows better.

153. stultitiam, i. e. the special
manifestation of folly, viz. avarice: so
too sapientior.
