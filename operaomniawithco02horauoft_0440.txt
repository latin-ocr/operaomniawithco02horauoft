Et crassum unguentum et Sardo cum melle papaver

HORATII ARS POETICA.

375

Offendunt, poterat duci quia cena sine istis:
Sic animis natum inventumque poema iuvandis,
Si paulum summo decessit vergit ad imum.
Ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis,

Indoctusque pilae discive trochive quiescit,

580

Ne spissae risum tollant impune coronae:

Qui nescit versus tamen audet fingere.

Quidni?

Liber et ingenuus, praesertim census equestrem
Summam nummorum vitioque remotus ab omni.

Tu nihil invita dices faciesve Minerva3

375. Compare the mixture of mean-
ness with luxury satirized in Nasidienus’
supper, Sat. 2. 8.

Sardo melle. ‘Corsicum et Sardum
mel pessimi saporis’ Porph. Cp. Virg.
Eel. 7. 41 ‘ Sardoniis . . . amarior herbis.’

papaver: ‘candidum cuius semen
tostum in secunda mensa cum melle
apud antiquos dabatur' Plin. N. H. 19.

376. duci: so ‘producere' Sat. 1. 5.
705 there is some idea of ‘from be-
ginning to end.’

377. animis iuvandis, Horace may
be thinking in the argument of Cic. de
Orat. 1. 26. 118 ‘ in eis artibus in quibus
non utilitas quaeritur necessaria, sed
animi libera quaedam oblectatio, quarn
diligenter et quam prope fastidiose
iudicamus.’

379—384. ‘ Yet, in spite of this ante-
cedent condemnation of second-rate
poetry, people treat it as the one art
which any one may praetise‚ whether
he understands it or not.' Cp. Epp. 2.
1. 114-117.

379. campestribus armis: see on
Od. 1. 8.12; cp. also Epp. 1. 18. 52, 54.
Virgil speaks (Georg. 1. 160) of the
‘ arma ’ of the husbandman.

380. pilae . . . disci . . . trochi: Sat.
1. 5. 48, 2. 2. 11, 15: Od. 3. 24. 57. In
the last two passages these games are
spoken of with contempt, as fit only
for Greeks, in comparison with the more
manly Roman sports of riding and
javelin throwing. Here Horace is taking
things as they are without comment, and
using the practice of the games only as
an illustration.

381. coronae: Epp. 1. 18. 53.

385

impune, ‘ freely,⁷ ‘without blame’; a
favourite word with Horace, and used
with some freedom: Od. 1. 17. 5, 1. 31.
15, 4· 9- 33; Epod-17-59; Epp- 1· 5·
10, 2.1.150‚ 2. 2. 1053 A. P. 210.

382. Question is raised as to the
punctuation. Bentl.‚ followed by Ritter
and Munro, put a comma after ‘ nescit
versus.’ It is perhaps better with Dillr.
to take it as an instance of the ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ constr. (see on Od. Ι. 3. 6),
‘versus fingere’ being the complement
of both verbs. The effect is helped, not
hindered, by the division of the two
words between the two clauses.

quidni, ‘ why should he noti' It is
siinpler to treat it as an ironical answer
of the poet's than with Orelli to change
the subj., and supply ‘audeam‚' as
though the poetaster spoke himself.

383. liber includes the ‘libertinus'
as well as the ‘ ingenuus,' ‘ free-born.'

census equestrem summam: the
constr. is found in Cic. Flacc. 32· 80
‘census es . . . centum tn'ginta HS.
milia’3 for the ‘equestris summa' see
Epp. 1. 1. 58.

384. vitio remotus ab omni: as
‘ sine crimine‘ Epp. 1.7. 56; ‘thoroughly
respectable.' Horace does not answer
the plea which answers itself, but ap-
peals to Piso not to aet in its spirit.

385. invita Minerva: explained by
Cicero de Off. 1. 31. 10 ‘nihil decet
invita ut aiunt Minewa, id est adver-
sante et repugnante Minerva'3 see on
Sat. 2. 2. 3. It is a repetition of the
precept of vv. 38-40: ‘ you will not be
like the crowd of scribblers, you will
consult your capacity before you begin.’
