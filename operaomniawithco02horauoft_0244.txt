HORATII EPISTULARUM

An pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur? 5
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque curo.
Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?

Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum?

Quid Titius, Romana brevi venturus in ora?

Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus, 10
Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos.

Ut valet? ut meminit nostri?

Fidibusne Latinis

Thebanos aptare modos studet auspice Musa, - ¹
An tragica desaevit et ampullatur in arte?

dri,’ Porph. The tower of Hero is
frequently spoken of, and Strabo, 13. 1.
22, speaks of a tower on the opposite
coast from which the passage between
Abydos and Sestos was made.

6. studiosa, used absolutely=‘ litte-
rata ' yComm. Cruq. ‘Operum ' follows
‘ quid.

cohors⁷ ‘suite't see on Sat. 1. 7.
23. ι
hoo, the question which precedes.
‘Mind you do not omit what is to me
the most interesting part.'

7. seribere sumit. For constr. ep.
Od.1.12.1, and see vol. 1. App. 2. ξ 1.

seribere, probably of poetry ; see on
Od. 1. 6. 1.

8. bella et paces. Either ‘how he

made war and peace,⁷ the plur. as in·

Sall. Jug. 31. 20 ‘ cum regna, provinciae,
leges, iura, iudicia, bella atque paces . . .
penes paucos erant,’ where see Kritz’s
note; or as in Epp. 2. Ι. 103 ‘bonae
paces,' ‘ times of war and times of peace.'
The first is perhaps most likely, as there
is no doubt special reference to the
mission of high politics on which
Tiberius was travelling.

diffundit. A metaphor of space
transf. to time; the pres. in the sense
‘is to spread?

9. Titius. Nothing is known of him
but what may be inferred from the text.
The Comm. Cruq. identifies him with
the Septimius of Od. 2. 6. 1 and Epp.
1. 9. 1 ς but this can hardly be right, as
both Titius and Septimius are gentile
names, which are not cumulated. We
gather from the text that he had
ventured on the task, from which Horace
in Od. 4. 2. 1 foll. professes to shrink,
of writing Latin lyrics in imitation of
Pindar, and that he wrote tragedies.

venturus in ora : soon to be on the

lips os all in Rome. Prop. 3. 9. 32
‘venies tu quoque in ora virum,' and
Virgil ⁶ volitare per ora ‘ G. 3. 9, ‘ferri
per ora' Aen. 12. 235.

10. Pindarici sontis: ‘to drink of
the fountain of Pindar‚' must mean, in
the first place, to seek the source of in-
spiration in Pindar (‘ Thebanos modos ’
v. 13), and in Pindar directly‚ not in imi-
tations in which his fresh stream stag-
nates or runs thinly (‘lacus et vivos’).
Mr. Prickard suggests with some prob-
ability that Horace had in mind also
Pindar‘s own expression sor what is ori-
ginal as against what is borrowed, which
Quintilian has preserved (10. 1. 109)
‘non pluvias (ut ait Pindarus) aquas
colligit [Cicero] sed vivo gurgite exun-
dat.

12. ut. valet? Sat. 2. 8. 1.

13. Thebanos, i.e. of Pindar, the
Theban.

auspice Musa, as Virg. has ‘dis
auspicibus ’ Aen. 4. 45.

14. desaevit,‘stor1ns.' The prep. as
in ‘ decertare ' Od. 1. 3. 13.

ampullatur. ‘Ampullor’ is a verb
coined perhaps by Horace from ‘ am-
pulla' in the sense in which it is used
in A. P. 97 ‘proiicit ampullas.’ The
two words evidently mean the using
of florid or bombastic language. Porph.
explains them as adaptations of the
Greek λήκυθος and ληκυθίζειν, quot-
ing ληκυθεῖος Μοῦσα from Callimachus.
Aer. and the Comm. Cruq. on the other
hand, without suggesting a Greek origin,
explain them from the shape of the
‘ampulla' <dim of ‘amphora'h ‘in-
flata ' Acr., ‘ventricosa' Comm. Cr. If
these explanations are to be combined,
as has been very generally assumed, it
will follow that Horace either con-
sciously or unconsciously put a turn on
