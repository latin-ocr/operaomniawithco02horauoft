ARs PoETICA. 385

Is he advising him (vv. 128 f.) to take an Homeric subject, or justify-
ing him in doing so? Is he implying (vv. 234 f.) that Piso includes
in his purpose a Satyric drama? These doubts are not more than
those which remain in Epp. 1. 18, as to whether Lollius is actually
the dependent of some great man or is only contemplating such
a position. We do not exclude in either case the literary purpose.
Horace writes not without consciousness osa larger audience. His
Epistle has its close relation to Piso's circumstances ; but in writing it,
as in publishing it, heis thinking also of the general circumstances of
Roman poetry, and adding another chapter to his apologia for the
aims and methods of the school which he admired and to which he
belonged.

Another interesting question, which has been often debated, is the
extent and nature of Horace's indebtedness to particular writers,
Greek or Latin, for the materials of his criticism. Porphyrion tells
us that Horace, in the Ars Poetica‚ ‘has put together precepts of
Neoptolemus of Parium, not all, but the most important'3 and he
carries out this view into some detail in the earlier part of the poem
by giving Greek names to succeeding ‘precepts‚' as vv. 1-9 περὶ
ἀκολουθίας, V. 28 περὶ εὐταξίας, ete.

A. Michaelis, who published in 1857 an exhaustive dissertation on
the subject ¹, has again in the later treatise 2, from which I have
quoted before, well characterized this statement, if it is to be inter-
preted at all literally, as ‘impossible and contradictory both of the idea
of an Horatian Epistle and of the whole tendency of Horace's poetry ³.'
Porphyrion may have noticed some points of resemblance between
Horace's treatment of the subject and that of Neoptolemus, and it is
