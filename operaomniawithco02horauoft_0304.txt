HORATII EPISTULARUM

Tu recte vivis si curas esse quod audis.

Iactamus iampridem omnis te Roma beatum3

Sed vereor ne cui de te plus quam tibi credas,

Neve putes alium sapiente bonoque beatum, 20
Neu si te populus sanum recteque valentem

Dictitet, occultam febrem sub tempus edendi

DissimuleS‚ donec manibus tremor incidat unctis.
Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat.

Si quis bella tibi terra pugnata marique 25
Dicat et his verbis vacuas permulceat aures,

feeling in this ‘ ethical dative' softens
the transition to the question of Quintius’
own lise. It is not so much ‘This is
how Ι live; how do you?' as though
Horace held up his own example broadly
to Quintius, as rather ‘ So 1 live, and so,
what I know you care for very much,
my health and happiness are secured.
What of your own 2 ’

Septembribus horis: the unhealthy
season3 Sat. 2. 6. 19, Epp. 1. 7. 5.

17. reete vivis: a phrase of Stoic
import which gives the keynote ofwhat
follows. It includes the having found
the true ideal and the following it, and
it implies happiness, Epp. Ι. 2. 41, 1. 6.
29, 1. 8. 4, 2. 2. 213.

esse quod audis, ‘to be what you
are said to be.‘ For the sense of ‘ audis ’
cp.Sat. 2. 6. 20, 2. 7. 101; Epp. 1. 7. 38.
Horace is of course referring to the con-
trast of δοκεῖν and εἶναι, ‘ esse ' and
‘ videri ' or ‘ haberi‚' which was a
commonplace with philosophers (as Cic.
Off. 2. 12. 43, Xen. Mem. 2. 6. 39), and
in what follows he will make that his
text, but at present his standing-point is
what the world is actually saying of
Quintius, ‘ we are calling you a happy
man. This is indeed to fulfil the ideal
of life, if you are taking care to be what
we call you. But see that you do not
only take our word for it, and remember

that happiness presupposes wisdom and
goodness.'

18. iactamus, ‘ have on our lips.’

iampridem: happiness is one step on
the road to ‘ recte vivere‚' and that step
has been already taken.

20. alium sapiente τ the abl. with
‘ alium‚' as Epp. 2. 1. 240 ‘ alius Ly-
sippo.' and, if ‘ veris ’ be read there, Sat.
2. 3. 208.

21. neu si populus, etc„ the third
sear is put figuratively; ‘ or be taking the
popular voice sor your happiness against
your own conscionsnessnvfflch would be
as absurd as to take it on the question
whether you have a sever or not, and so
go to a feast only to find the ague-
shaking come on you in the middle of it.’

sanum reeteque valentem : Epp. 1.

si dictitet: ‘if they say it often
enough.’

22. occultam: pred. with ‘ dissimu-
les’ ; ‘ hide and pretend not to feel it.’

23. unctis, ‘already in the dish!
This reminds us that the Romans ate
with their fingers. Ov. A. A. 3. 755
‘ Carpe cibos digitis3 est quidam gestus
edendi : Ora nec immunda tota perunge
manu.

24. stultorum, the emphatic word,
the opposite of‘ sapiente ’ in v. 20. ‘ And
that is not at all like a philosopher, to
hide your sores instead of getting them
cured.’

pudor malus: cp. ‘pudens prave'
A. P. 88 ; ⁶ false shame‚’ i.e. shame which
mistakes its object.

2 5— 31. ‘ You would detect the falseness
at once if people used language of you
in military and politica] matters which
would be applicable ,onlyto an Augustus;
why not when in moral ones they use
language which is applicable only to the
ideal sage ⁴? '

25. tibi: it is doubted whether the
dat. is to be taken with pugnata or
with dicat. Either is possible and
makes good sense, the former is perhaps
best.

26. vacuas : at leisure, when you¹
attend to him. Lucr. 1. 45 ‘ vacuas
aures . . . adhibe.‘
