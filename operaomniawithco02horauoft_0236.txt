224 HORATII EPISTULARUM

E PISTLE ΙΙ.

ΤΟ LOLLIUS.

Verses 1-4. 1 HAVE been re-reading my Homer, Lollius. He is a better teacher of
morals than your Stoics and Academies.

5-8. The whole story is full of the follies both of the few and of the many.

9—16. Antenor and Nestor, in the Iliad, are the pffllosophers, going to the root of
the matter, showing the way of safety, composing foolish quarrels. Paris,
AchilleS, and Agamemnon ⁴are the ‘ madmen ' of common life, refusing to be
saved, driven headlong by desire or anger. The many suffer for the sins of the
few. Life and its follies are the same in both camps.

17-31. So in the Odyssey, Ulysses is the philosopher, studying life, thinking for
others, proof against adverssty, deas to the Sirens and to Circe, while his
comrades fall victims to them. We find our part in the ciphers of the story,
the suitors, the courtiers of Alcinous, prodigals, fops, and loungers.

32-39. This is the bane of life. NVake up, show in a good cause something of the
energy which robbers show in a bad. Laziness will avenge itself in the
ease of moral health as of physical.

40—43. Do not procrastinate. Time waits for no man.

44, 45. You plead excuses. Yon are busy on legitimate objeets of desire.

46-54. Be it so, but set a limit to these. Remember that wealth to be enjoyed
presupposes health to enjoy, health of mind as well as body.

55—62. Pleasure is often bought too dear. Avarice is perpetual poverty. Envy
is a torment. Anger is a temporary insanity.

62-67. These can all be tamed if you treat the mind as you treat your horse and
your dog—break it in early.

67-70. Listen to me while you are young. Early lessons are long retained.

70, 71. But, whether you listen or not, I shall go my own paee.

This Epistle is to be read with the First. It is an instance of the rudimentary
philosophy, the thoughts on lise and morals, which Horace represents himself then as
storing. They are brought out now for the benefit of a young man. Homer's
poems are only the text and excuse, a link, it may be, between Lollius' old studies
and new needs. But we see elsewhere <see on Epp. ῐ. 16. 73) that Horace was in-
clined as he read the Greek poets to find for himself moral applications of their
legends.

The ‘ Lollius ' of this Epistle aud (we may suppose) of the Eighteenth is a young
man who in the later Epistle is spoken of as having served under Augustus in the
Cantabrian campaign, B.C. 25, 24. He is possibly the son of the M. Lollius to
whom Od. 4. 9 is addressed. ’

Various theories have been held as to the meaning of the appellation ‘ Maxime ’
given to him in v. 1. It has been taken (1) as=‘natu maxime‚’ as though there
were several brothers. One brother is mentioned in Epp. 1. 18.63. Cp. ‘ Omaior
iuvenum ⁷ A. P. 366. This is Orelli's view, but it has been pointed out that there
is no authority for the use of ‘ maxime ' by itself in the sense of ‘ eldest.’ (2) As
either literally or playfully =‘ illustrious‚’ the former by those who with the Scholiasts
take the Epistle to be addressed to M. Lollius who was consul in B.C. 21 ; among
