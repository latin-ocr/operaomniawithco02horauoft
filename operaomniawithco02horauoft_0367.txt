Floribus et vino Genium memorem brevis aevi.

Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem

Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit,
Libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos
Lusit amabiliter, donec iam saevus apertam
In rabiem coepit verti iocus et per honestas

Ire domos impune minax,

Doluere cruento

Condicione super communi3 quin etiam lex
Poenaque lata, malo quae nollet carmine quemquam

14, A. P. 210. The genius, as de-
scribed in Epp. 2. 2. 187 foll„ was the
man’s self, so that, translated out of
mythological language, this is: ‘Said
to themselves, crown yourselves with
flowers and drink‚ for tomorrow you
die?

145. Fescennina licentia: cp. Liv.
7. 2, in speaking of the first introduction
of regular dramatie representations‚ ‘his-
trionibus . . . qui non sicut ante Fescen-
nino versu similem incompositum temere
ac rudem alternis iaciebant.’ The adj.
was used in later times of the ribaldry
which accompanied the marriage pro-
cession: ‘Fescennina locutio' Catull.
61. 120. It was variously derived by
ancient scholars from Fescennia, a town
of Etruria (Virg. Aen. 7. 695: cp. the
connection of the ‘ fabulae Atellanae' with
Atella), or from ‘fascinum.' See Mumo,
Critieisms and Elucidations of Catullus,
pp. 76 foll„ and Nettleship’s Earliest
Italian Literature, Journal of Philo-
logy, vol. ii. pp. 191 soll.

fustis, ‘the cudgel,⁷ a natural meta-
phor‚ especially where there is meant
to be some satire in the description.
Editors however generally suppose a
reference to the punishment (so sar as
we know only a military one inflicted
011 dese1·ters⁷ ete.) called ‘fustuarium'
(Cic. Phil. 3. 6. 14, Liv. 5. 6), which
consisted in being beaten to death with
cudgels and stones. They point out
that in the XII Tables the penalty for
libellous verse was death. It is doubtful

carmine ' 3 ‘ civil speaking.'
