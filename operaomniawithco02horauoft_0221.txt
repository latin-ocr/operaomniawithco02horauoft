present in the composition of any particular Epistle. But Horace.
meant us, we may be sure, to see this element in the Epistle itself‚
not to depend upon tradition for it.

It must be added that the Epistolary form becomes in some cases
a matter of play—as when he makes a professed letter to his bailiff
the vehicle for the humorous expression of his own love of the
country and dislike of restlessness (Ep. 14); when he puts an
apology to Augustus into the form of a letter sent after the mes-
senger who is supposed to be carrying to him a volume of poems
(Ep. 13), or when he addresses to his own Book of collected
Epistles the confidences and anticipations which he means for his
world-wide audience-to-be (Ep. 20).

In calling his Epistles ‘Sermones' he is expressing the continuity
in substance, and even in form, which unites the most important of
them, those for the sake of which the book was written, to the
Satires. Their subject is the same, that which always interested
him most deeply,—the art oflife. It runs into the same topics, the
folly of avarice, the wisdom of enjoying instead of wishing, the
charm of country life, of moderate tastes, of contentment. He
fingers amusedly, as before, the paradoxes of philosophers, and puts
even more confidently his view that more is to be learnt from
common sense and from the poets than in the schools. The style
is the same—the free and unrhetorical style of the best conversation,
playful and serious by turns, lighted up by wit, good humour,
touches of poetry. It still cuts an argument short with an anecdote
or a fable. There is the same tendency to use an individual name
where a class is meant, and in doing so to mix indiscriminately
names of the day with literary or even mythological reminis-
cences¹. The epistolary form is in truth as much a dramatic
adaptation as the form of dialogue adopted in Book II of the
Satires. As Acron remarks, it is conversation still, conversation
with the absent instead of conversation held or overheard, with the
present: ‘Epistulis enim ad absentes loquimur, sermone curn prae-
sentibus ².’ In speaking of the Satires we noticed the influence
