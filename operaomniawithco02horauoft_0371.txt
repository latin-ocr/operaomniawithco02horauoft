LIB. 11.

EPIST. 1.

Saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poetam,
Quod numero plures, virtute et honore minores,
Indocti stolidique, et depugnare parati

Si discordet equeS, media inter carmina poscunt

185

Aut ursum aut pugiles3 his nam plebecula gaudet.
Verum equitis quoque iam migravit ab aure voluptas
Omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana.

Quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas,

Dum fugiunt equitum turmae peditumque catervae3

190

Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis,
Esseda festinant, pilenta, petorrita, naves,
Captivum portatur ebur, captiva Corinthus.

182 foll. ‘ There is a stronger reason
in the bad taste of audiences who care
now for nothing but shows.' It will be
noticed that Horace has come down to
his own time, but the complaint of the
preference of rope-dancers and gladia-
tors to the drama is as old as Terence.
See both prologues to the Hecyra.

182. audacem. ‘one who faces the
risk just spoken of.‘ The metaphors pass
into one another. ‘ He is frightened by
the “ numero plures ” and their militant
eagerness for spectacles.’

183. For the different views taken by
different parts of the house cp. Sat. 1.
10. 76 soll., A. P. 113, 248.

184. depugnare, ‘to fight to the
death’: Od. 1. 3. 1311.

185. earmina: here of dramatic
poetry‚ as in A. P. 220.

186. plebecula: the diminutive of
contempt, as 'popello’ Epp 1. 7. 65.

gaudet: the reading of V, as well
as other good MSS„ and it stands in the
note of Porph. Orelli stands almost
alone in reading ‘plaudit‚’ for which
there is very little authority, although
some good MSS. have ‘ plaudet.'

188. incertos, “restless.’

189. aulaea premuntur : A. P. 154;
‘ the curtain is· kept down,' i.e. the per-
formance continues, The curtain, as is
well known, was drawn upwards‚ not,
as with us, let fall, Virg. G. 3. 25, Ov.
Met. 3. 111, What is described is ap-
parently military spectacles‚ processions,
etc„ introduced into plays, such as Ci-
cero deseiibcs himself as being bored
with ad Fam. 7. 1. 2 ⁴ quid enim delec-
tationis habent sescenti muli in Clytem-
nestra‘? aut in Equo Troiano catenarum

tria milia? aut armatura varia pedi-
tatus et equitatus in aliqua pugna?
quae popularem admirationem habuerunt
delectationem tibi nullam attulissent)
⁴ Fugiunt‚’ therefore, in ν. 190, possibly
describes a battle-scene (as Porph. took
iti—the subsequent triumph being in—
troduced by ‘mox' in v. 191. ⁴ Fugiunt'
might also be taken (as ‘ festinant' in
v. 192) for ‘ pass rapidly.'

191. trahitur: Od. 4. 2. 34.

manibus retortis: Od. 3. 5. 22n.

regum fortuna: a poetical variation;
what the eye sees is the kings; but
they are to the mind a picture passing
before it of the vicissitudes to which
kings are liable.

192. esseda, pilenta, petorrita,
‘ chariots of every shape and kind?
Perhaps this is all that is meant. The
Scholiasts treat them as belonging to
the different parts of the triumphal pro-
cession; ‘ esseda' <the war-chariots of
the Belgae and Britanni, familiar in
Caesar) being those in which the captive
princes rode; the ‘pilenta' (used in
processions by Roman niatrons, Liv. 5.
25. and to carry sacred vessels, etc,
Virg. Aen. 8. 666) for the captive prin—
cesses; and ‘petorrita' (see on Sat. Ι.
6. 104) for their households. Professor
Nettleship has suggested that in these.
as in the words that follow, the triumphs
over different nations are indicated.

193. captiva Corinthus. The anti-
thesis with captivum ebur perhaps fixes
this to mean ‘ spoils ofCorinthian brass.'
Otherwise we might take it of a model
or picture such as was frequently carried
in atriumph. Cicero [Pis 2560) enume-
rates ‘ simulacra oppidorum ' among the
