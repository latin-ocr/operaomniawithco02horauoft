GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
SATIRES.

ἓ 1. Dz’vz'sion (gf the two Books.

IT may be taken for certain that the division of the two Books of
Satires is a real and chronological division, not merely, like that of
the first three books of the Odes, the division for artistic purposes of
a collection given to the world together. Such a real division is indi-
cated by the very definite epilogue with which the First Book is
concluded and the prologue with which the Second Book opens. No
doubt something of this effect is given by the placing of Od. 2. 20
and 3. 1, and in a slighter way still by that of Od. 1. 37, 38 and
2. 1 3 but in the case of the Odes there is no mistake when we come
to Od. 3. 30 and compare it with I. Ι, that we have in them the true
prologue and epilogue to the work as a whole. To make the parallel
effective, Book II of the Satires should have an epilogue which
would mark not only the close of a Book but the achievement of a
full purpose. Sat. ΙΙ is ended in a manner suitable to the more
dramatie character of the Book, not by a conscious epilogue,
but by a sketch lighter in tone than the two which precede
it, and one which gathers up and puts in more dramatic form
some of the chief topics of the book and especially of its earlier
part. Amongst Horace’s collections of poems it is analogous to the
conclusion of the Epodes and of the IVth Book of the Odes, not to
that of Sat. Ι, Odes I-III‚ or Epp. Ι. He has his two manners,
evidently, of ending a Book : but this does not render it more prob-
able that he should have published the two Books of Satires
together and ended the first with ‘ I puer, atque meo citus haec sub-
scribe libello‚' and the second with ‘velut illis Canidia afflasset
peior serpentibus Afris.'

But in truth the two Books stand apart from one another widely,
both in general form and topics‚ and also in tone personal and
