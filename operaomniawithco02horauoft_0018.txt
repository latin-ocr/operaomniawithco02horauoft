lex¹ ') to be paralleled only in some of the earlier Epodes. There is
more appearance of those liberties taken with persons of position (not
merely the thieves, moneylenders, misers, and parasites of later
Satires) and of broad references to real scandals, which he professes
to defend in Sat. 1. 4 and 2. I, but with apologies which, if we look
at any Satire but this one, seem to outrun the needs of the case ².
There is above all the curious tradition of the Scholiasts that under
the name of Maltinus <or Malchinus) he was satirizing in v. 25 the
personal habit of Maecenas. If this be true it is so completely un-
like Horace⁷s bearing towards his friends in high position that it
must mean that the Satire was written before his acquaintance with
Maecenas commenced, and preserved with Maecenas' assent if not
at his desire.

Horace uses two words to designate his Satires.

1. The only title which he uses within >the Satires themselves is
Satira. This he employs in Sat. 2. 1. 1 in the singular, to describe
the form of composition or its spirit, ‘ Sunt quibus in satira videar nimis
acer.² He is there speaking of himself as the successor of Lucilius, and
the word has our modern sense of ‘ Satire,' the censorious criticism of
life and manners of which Lucilius had set the type. In Sat. 2. 6. 17
he employs the plural of the separate poems: ‘Quid prius illustrem
satiris?' and it may be noticed that there he has in view another
aspect of Satire‚ familiar also to Lucilius (as he points out in Sat.
2. 1. 30—36), but descending to him from the older ‘Satura' or
medley, of Satire namely as a vehicle for autobiographical details
and the expression of personal likes as well as dislikes.

2. But it is noticeable that in the Epistles, when he looks back at
the Satires and ranks them with his other kinds of composition
he drops entirely the term ‘ Satirae.' His classification is ‘Iambi,'
‘Carmina,⁷ ‘Sermones' In Epp. 1. 4. 1 the first place where he uses
this term—‘sermonum nostrorum candide iudex,'—he is probably
speaking of the Satires only3 and so too in Epp. 2. 2. 60, where he

¹ When anything like it recurs in

Sat. 2. 7 it is in a place where he is
dramatizing the licence of the Satur-
nalia, and possibly caricaturing also the
tone osprofessed moral lecturers. In the
same way the four lines which disfigure
Sat. 1. 5 are due probably to an incident

flinging away his shield at Philippi
(Od. 2. 7. 10) is due to the similar pro-
fession of Alcaeus.

² Is not Sat. 2 the one specimen
which Horace allowed to be preserved
osan earlier type of Satires which had
been shown to friends, but which his

 

in Lucilius' journey (3. 54) which he is
reproducing, much as the story of his

own fastidious taste failed finally to
approve?
