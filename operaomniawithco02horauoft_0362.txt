HORATII EPISTULARUM

Compositum illepideve putetur, sed quia nuper;

Nec veniam antiquis, sed honorem et praemia posci.

Recte necne crocum floresque perambulet Attae

Fabula si dubitem, clament periisse pudorem 80
Cuncti paene patres, ea cum reprehendere coner

Quae gravis Aesopus, quae doctus Roscius egit:

Vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducunt,

Vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus, et quae

Imberbi didicere, senes perdenda fateri. 85
Iam Saliare Numae carmen qui laudat, et illud

be held not only (which it may be) an
excuse for desects, but a ground of praise
and preference in itself.’

erasse, ‘ of coarse texture’: opp.
‘tenui filo’ inf. v. 225.

79. crocum floresque, sc. ‘scenam
. . . ubi flores sparguntur’ Acr. For the
sprinkling of essence of saffron on the
stage cp. Lucr. 2. 416 ‘Et cum scena
croco Cilici perfusa recens est,' Martial.
5. 25. 7 ‘rubro pulpita nimbo Spargere
et effuso permaduisse croco?

reete perambulet: ‘to tread the
boards without stumbling ’ is in the first
place an adaptation of the common
figurative use of ‘stare‚’ ‘cadere,' of
theatrical success and failure: cp. vv. 174,
176. A comparison however of that
passage makes it probable that the words
are meant to hit by the way some special
characteristic of Atta’s plays. The most
obvious explanation is that ‘ perambu-
lare ’ (cp. Od. 4. 5. 17 n.), as contrasted
with ‘ percurrere ' in v. 174, implies
a pompous style or slowness of move-
ment. There are two more far-fetched
suggestions, (1) of Porphyrion, that the
whole expression refers not to treading
the stage, but to a long list of flowers
given in a special play named ‘ Mater-
tera,' which is taken as a typica] instance
of his wordiness ; (2) of Lambinus,
that there is a play on the meaning of
Atta which is said by Festus (s. v.) to
have been a nickname of the poet, and
to have meant ‘ one who walks with a
tripping gait ' ; ‘ qui plantis insistunt et
attingunt potius terram quam ambu—
lant.'

Attae. T. Quintius Atta, a writer
of ⁴togatae‚’ died in B.C. 78. A few
fragments and the titles of a few of his
plays are all that remains of him.

81. patres: probably in the sense of
‘ senators,' the front row of the audience.
Cp. ‘centuriae seniorum ¹ A. P. 342.
They represent the orthodox and middle-
aged opinion. Orelli and others take it
as in v. 109=‘ seniores.’

82. Aesopus . . . Roscius: the
famous actors of Cicero’s time; the for-
mer of tragedies (see on Sat. 2. 3. 239)
‘summus artifex, et semper partium in
republica tam quam in scena optirnarum'
Cic. pro Sest. 56. 1203 the latter of
comedy. Cicero says of him (de Orat.
1. 28. 130) that his standard of perfec-
tion was so high that ‘ a Roscius in his
own line’ had become a proverb for
a master in any art. ‘ Gravis‚⁷ ⁴ doctus ⁹
suit these descriptions. They are meant,
however, not to give original judgments,
but to be the conventional epithets on
the lips of the ‘ patres.⁷ ‘ Ea quae . . .
egit ’ is not to be limited to the plays of
Atta, which indeed Aesopus, if, as
seems likely, he was a tragic actor only,
would not have acted. It is general;
the ‘patres ’ take it for granted that
Horace's criticism on Atta is only a
sample.

84. minoribus ; Α. P. 174.

85. imberbi. The extant MSS.
have ‘ imberbes,' but V and the Comm.
Cruq. had the form ‘imberbi ' here, and
‘ imberbus ’ in A. P. 161.

86. iam marks a new point in the
argument. ‘ This veneration for anti-
quity is only masked spite against con-
temporary genius?

Numae: because the institution of
the Salii was traced to Numa, Liv. 1.
20, ⁴ Saliorum carmina vix sacerdotibus
suis satis intellecta⁷ Quint. 1. 6. 40. See
XVordsworth's Fragm. of Anc. Latin,
pp. 562 foll.
