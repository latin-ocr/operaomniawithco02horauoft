HORATII SATIRARUM

Praebuit, et parochi quae debent ligna salemque.

Hinc muli Capuae clitellas tempore ponunt.

Lusum it Maecenas, dormitum ego Vergiliusque;

Namque pila lippis inimicum et ludere crudis.

Hinc nos Coccei recipit plenissima villa, 50

Quae super est Caudi cauponas.

Nunc mihi paucis

Sarmenti scurrae pugnam Messique Cicirrhi‚
Musa, velim memores, et quo patre natus uterque

Contulerit lites.
Sarmenti domina exstat:
Ad pugnam venere.

Esse feri similem dico.'

5. 10 and 21. Porph. gives ¹ copiarii'
as the proper Latin name of these
‘parochi.’ ‘Parochus’ is used in a
transferred sense in Sat. 2. 8. 36.

47. tempore, ‘ in good time‚' ‘early3‘
see Kritz on Sall. Jug. 56.

48. lusum, sc. ‘ pila? For the game
of ball see on Sat. 1. 6. 126. It is
noticed that Horace dwells on what
shows the individual freedorn allowed
in Maecenas’ circle.

49. lippis z see above on v. 30.
Horace had no infirmity which pre-
vented him from playing ball at times;
see Sat. 2. 6. 49, where he speaks of
playing with Maecenas.

inimicum. Sat. 2. 4. 53.

crudis. ‘those suffering from indi-
gestion.' Epp. 1. 6. 61. The author
of the life of Virgil which bears Dona-
tus' name mentions among his ail-
ments that ‘plerumque stomacho labo-
ravit.'

51. super, the meaning is fixed by
‘Caudi cauponast‘ they overshot the
usual hasting-place, the inns of Cau-
dium. It is worth noticing that a large
number of good MSS. (all the Bland.
included) read ‘Claudi‚' an illustration
of the untrustworthiness of MSS. in
the case of proper names; see on Od.
3. 16. 41, 3. 20. 15. The mistake is
later than the scholia of Porph.‚ who
has without hesitation ‘supra tabernas
Caudi oppidi.' It has begun to infect
those of the Pseudo-Acron, which has
side by side ‘Caudium est civitas Sam-
nii? Lucan. ‘Ultra Caudinas speravit
volnera furcas‚’ and ‘supra Caudi (some
MSS. ‘Claudi ') cuiusdam cauponas?

Messi clarum genus Osci;

ab his maioribus orti 55
Prior Sarmentus: ‘Equi te

Ridemus‚ et ipse

nuno mihj paucis, a mock heroic
commencement. Cp. Juvenal‘s intro-
duction of the story of the great fish,
4. 34 foll. Horace describes an encounter
of wit between two buffoons (much like
two jesters of feudal times), one of
whom (Sarmentus) is travelling in Mae·
cenas' train-the other (Messius) is a
native of the neighbouring country <the
Oscan language covered Samnium as
well as Campania, see Liv. 10. 20), ,Ι
and belongs probably to Cocceius’ 5
household. l:

52. Sarmenti. Juv. S. 5. 3 ‘ Si potes
illa pati quod nec Sarmentus iniquas
Caesaris ad mensas nee vilis Galba
tulisset,' on which the Scholiast tells us
that he was of Etruscan origin, a slave
of M. Favonius, who, on the proscription
and death of his master, passed into Mae-
cenas‘ possession, and was freed by him ;
he became a ‘scriba’ and sat in the
knights' seats, which exposed him to
a prosecution. He fell again eventually
to indigence.

Cicirrhi, κίκιρρος aec. to Hesychius
meant ‘ a cock.’

54. contulerit lites„ a modification
of ‘ conferre certamina‚’ to suit the ,
wordy fray.

clarum : merely ironical‚ as ‘ opicus ’
= ‘ elownish ;’ or with special reference
to the combat to come, ‘ famous in this ’
field;' the ‘Atellanae fabulae’ (Liv.
7. 2) originated with them.

Osci may be nom. plur. or gen. :
sing. ¹

55. domina, sc. the widow of Fa· “
vonms ; see on v. 52.
