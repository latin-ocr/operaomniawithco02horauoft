133. lectulus. Suet. Aug. 78 ‘ A
cena lucubratoriam se in lecticulam re-
cipiebat. Ibi donee residua diurni actus
aut omnia aut ex maxima pane confi-
ceret, ad multam noctem permanebat-—
in lectum inde trangressus.' So Ovid.
Trist. Ι. 11. 37 ‘Non haec in nostris ut
quondam scripsimus hortis, Nec, con—
suete, meum, lectule, corpus habes?
Horace spent the morning till ten o'clock
on his couch, Sat, 1. 6. 122.

134. porticus. Ep. 1. 1. 71, of the
colonnades, ofwhich there were so many
in Rome (a fragment remains of the
Porticus Octaviae, see Burn’s Rome and
The Campagna‚ p. 308) in which the
citizens walked, or were carried in litters
(Juv. S. 7. 178), and even drove (ib.

135. vivam melius. It covers both
‘ better' and ‘ more happily;’ see above,
v. 109, and compare the use of ‘bene
vivere’ in a quasi-philosophical sense in
the Epistles, Epp. 1. 6. 56, 1. 11. 29,
1. 15. .

137.4ξ olim,’ ‘some day,’ A. P. 3863
see on Epod. 3. 1.

139. illudo chartis. The deprecia-
tory use of ‘ ludo ' of a man’s own com-
positions (as in Sat. 1. 10. 37, see on Od.
1. 32. 2) with the addition ‘in chartis.’

Horace is giving a final account of his
writing of Satire. It is his playful and
childlike method of sels-rebuke and sels-
instruction.

141. veniat. It does not seem neees-
sary to read ‘veniet' against the majority
of MSS. The coming is put hypotheti-
cally, the result, if they do come, as
a certain future.

142. multo plures, a comic exagger-
ation tProf. Palmer well compares Juv.
S. 14. 276 ‘plus hominum iam est in
pelago‚’ ‘ there are more men nowadays
at sea than on land ’), which serves the
purpose of bringing the Satire to a close,
suggesting at the same time Horace's
familiar ironical plea sor writing (od.
1. Ι, Sat. 2. Ι. 24 foll.)‚ that he claims
the freedom os taste that all others claim.
Here it is ‘more than half the world
write poetry of some kind, and we should
make common cause.'

143. Iudaei: the ref. is to their pro-
selytizing spirit, S. Matr. 23. 15.

in hane turbam, sc. ‘in manum poet-
arum.’

concedere. There is a certain play
in keeping the same verb in slightly
different senses: ‘ If you won⁷t yield to
us in one way you will have to do so in
another.‘
