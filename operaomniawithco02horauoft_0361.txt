LIB. II.

EPIST. 1.

345

Ad nostrum tempus Livi scriptoris ab aevo.
Interdum volgus rectum videt, est ubi peccat.
Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas

Ut nihil anteferat, nihil illis comparet, errat:

Si quaedam nimis antique, si pleraque dure
Dicere credit eos, ignave multa fatetur,

Et sapit et mecum facit et Iove iudicat aequo.
Non equidem insector delendaque carmina Livi

Esse reor, memini quae plagosum mihi parvo

70

Orbilium dictare3 sed emendata videri
Pulchraque et exactis minimum distantia miror;
Inter quae verbum emicuit si forte decorum, et
Si versus paulo concinnior unus et alter,

Iniuste totum ducit venditque poema.

est ubi peceat: see on Od. 1. 1. 3.
This is possibly an instance where the
indicative is preferred on purpose. It
is a single blunder of which he speaks,

66. pleraque, ‘many‚’ not neees-
sarily ‘ most‚’ things: see on the use of
‘ plerumque ⁷ Sat. 1. 10. 15.

67. ignave, ‘ dully‚' ‘ without spirit.'
This is a worse charge than ‘antique ‘
or ‘ dure,‘ and so we pass from ‘ credit ’
to ‘ fatetur! This is an answer to Bent-
ley's argument in favour of ‘cedit‚’ a
reading of little authority.

68. meeum facit: Epp. 2. 2. 23;
‘takes my side.‘

Iove iudicat aequ0‚ ‘Jove smiles on
its judgment‚’ i. e. it judges wisely. Cp.
‘invita Minerva ² A. P. 385 ; ‘Iove qui-
dem irato fit ut errent homines et deli-
rent’ Porph.

69. ‘I do not go into the opposite
extreme and rail against the ancient
writers as fit only to be destroyed.'

Livi. Livius Andronicus, taken as
a representative of the early writers.
Cicero speaks (Brutus 18. 74) of his
Latin Odyssey as a puzzle, ‘opus ali-
quod Daedali‚' and says of his plays
that they were ‘non satis dignae quae
iterum legantur.'

70. plagosum Orbilium. Orbilius
was a native of Beneventum, who set up
a school in Rome in B.c. 63. Suetonius
gives a short lise of him among the
‘ illustres grammatici* With respect to

the epithet he says ‘fuit naturae acerbae
non modo in antisophistas quos omni
sermone laceravit sed etiam in discipulos,
ut Horatius significat plagosum eum
appellans, ut Domitius Marsus scribens
“Si quos Orbilius ferula scutieaque
cecidit.”' For other references to
Horaee's school days see Sat. 1. 6. 76
f011.‚Epp. 2. 2. 41 soll.

71. dictare: Sat. 1. 10. 71.

72. exactis, ‘ perfect?

75. ducit venditque 3 the single
happy word or neat line passes off the
poem. The metaphor of ‘vendit' is
common. Cp. Juv. S. 7. 135 ‘purpura
vendit Causidicum,’ ‘vendibilis orator’
Cic. Brut. 47. 174. That of ‘ ducit ’ is
not so clear. It is usually taken of
a gaug of slaves sor sale, the best put in
frent, and so making the lot look better
than it is, ‘ ceterorum agmen ducit'
Ritter. wilkins compares the Ciceronian
metaph. ‘ familiam ducere‚' lit. to be the
foremost of a gang of slaves: see King
on Cic. Phil. 5. 11. 30. Bentley felt
the difficulty so much that he wished to
follow what is probably only a mis-
wn'ting of Regin. ‘venit‚’ making
‘poema' the subj., ‘the whole poem
takes in the purchaser and finds a mar-
ket.'

76. indignor follows up the feeling
of ‘ iniuste.’ ⁴ Ι feel keenly the injustice
that this implies, that modern work
should be blamed, not for its faults, but
sor being modern, that antiquity should
