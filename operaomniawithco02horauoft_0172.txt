160 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE IV.

CATIUS, OR THE ART OF DINING.

HORACE meets Catius hurrying home to arrange his notes of a gastronomical
lecture which he has just heard. When pressed to name the leeturer he makes
a mystery of it, but he gives the heads of the lecture (1—10).

It comprised hints on choosing eggs (11—14)‚ cabbage (15, 16), on dressing
a fowl hastily so as to be tender (17—20)‚ on choosing mushrooms (20, 21), on
the wholesomeness of certain articles of diet (21—29), the season and loeality
of various shellfish (30-34), the importance of studying sauces (35—39), subtle
points with respect to the condition and age of various animals, fish, and birds
(40—46)‚ the error of concentrating attention on one thing in a banquet and
forgetting others equally important (47—50)‚ the treatment of different wines
(51—57), and the way to keep a drinker in taste for his wine (58-62)‚ the corn-
position of the ‘ simple' and ‘double’ sance (63-69), the choice of apples and
grapes for dessert (7072), the garnishing of the table (73—75)‚ size of dishes,
tricks of slaves, importance of cleanliness in arrangements (76—87).

The Satire ends with Horace’s expressions of admiration and earnest entreaty
to be taken where such lore and secrets of happiness were to be learnt (88—95).

Who was Catius, and what is his relation to the gastronomic lecture of which
he is the mouthpiece? It can hardly be a name which carried no associations,
for the drama would lael< point.

1. The Scholiasts give us a complete answer and one which meets fairly the
conditions. They say (Ι) that Catius was an Epicurean who had written a
treatise ‘de Rerum Natura et de summo bono'; (2) that in this Satire Horace
is playing with the Epicureans as in the last he played with the Stoics.

It is a striking confirmation of this statement that (as they do not say) a Catius
is named in one of Cicero's letters (ad Fam. 15. 16). He is rallying Cassius on
his Epicurean tenets, and quotes jestingly a use of the term ‘ spectra’ by ‘ Catius
Insuber Epicureus qui nuper est mortuus.' If this is the person meant the
dramatic sramework of this Satire will turn, as does that of the first and of the
third Satire in this book, on a character from Cicero's Epistles.

Some such play as the Scholiasts suggest suits well enough with Horace's
attitude towards rival philosophies, with his principle of placing his poems
(whether Satires, Epistles, or Odes) as companion or contrasted pictures‚ and
possibly with hints in the Satire itself*. We need not make this relation between
Catius and the discourse on cookery very close. Horace’s primary purpose was
probably to laugh at people who made gastronomy into a seience and professed
to know better than their neighbours how to cook a chicken or arrange a dinner
table (cp. the play of Sat. 2. 8). It occurred to him to give a further point to
the Satire by its framing and placing, much as he gives a point to the idyllie

ἐξ“”Ιῖ 1s difficult to know how much one reads into a poem when once a theory of its purpose
is conceived, but vhatever hints of play there are seem to point in this direction. Catius i
v. 3 speaks of the lecture as a philosophy: that he does not name Epicurus may be dramatic.
Horace in v. 95 welcornes the teaching as an art of living, not only os dining,‘ vitae praecepta
leataef and parodies the famous x vsord of Lucretius, as though to sugges st that it is a new ‘De
Re1 rum Natura' that we have been listening to. Add theg reference to the attitude of the
sapiens’ in the presence of these problems (v. ζ’44), the criticism ofa p1evious teachertv. 24), the
affectation of such tei-ms as &praecepta ‘quaesitas ‘ingenium,' ‘suatura ‘ratim’
