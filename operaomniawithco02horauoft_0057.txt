Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
Pugnabant armis quae post fabricaverat usus,
Donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
Nominaque invenere; dehinc absistere bello,

Oppida coeperunt munire et ponere leges,

Ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis adulter.

Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus teterrima belli
Causa, sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,

Quos venerem incertam rapientes more ferarum

Viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus.

Iura inventa metu iniusti fateare necesse est,
Tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.
Nec natura potest iusto secernere iniquum,
Dividit ut bona diversis, fugienda petendis;

100. mutum et turpe pecus. All
the words describe man as not yet dis-
tinguished from the lower animals ;
⁶ mutum ' has reference to the invention
of language v. 103.

glandem. Lucr. 5. 939, Virg. G. Ι. 8,
the suitable food of men as imagined in
their primeval forests, ‘ silvestres homi-
nes' A. P. 391.

101. ita porro, and so on pro-
gressively.

102. usus, ‘ need.'

103. verba . . . nominaque, A. P.
234, the Greek ῥήματα καὶ ὀνόματα, a
rough classification of parts of speech3
the two standing together for language
— language with all its apparatus.
Language was the first necessary step
towards law. Before that, they had felt
the inconvenience of unrestrained desines,
but had not learnt to classify and name
their annoyances (thest, eto). It is evi-
dent then, Horace argues, that law is not
an original part of our nature but an in-
vention slowly attained and for the prac-
tical end of restraining the lawlessness
of a state of nature.

voces sensusque notarent: ‘nota-
rent ' is used by a kind of zeugma, ⁴ give
meaning to their sounds and expression
to their feelings.’
‘ vocibus sensus notarent‚' but the phrase
is from Lucr. 5. 1058 ‘ Pro vario sensu
varias res voce notaret.'

106. fur . . . latro. The second adds
the idea of violence, so that the line

generally describes the sanctity given
to property, life, marriage.

107,108. For a new setting of the
thought of these lines see Od. 4. 9. 25,
ete. ⁶ Vixere sortes ante Agamemnona.'

109. incertam, ¹ lawless.’

110. editior, ‘the superior '3 ἅπαξ λ.
in this sense.

111. iniusti. The use of the word
involves cx hypothesi an anachronismi,
but it helps to make the point elearer.
Horace argues that there is no trans-
cendental, preexistent⁷ ‘ius ' or ‘iustuml
They are asterthoughts‚ resorted to for
the purpose of stamping a state of things
which existed before them and the vexa-
tions of which had been felt. Certain
actions were inconvenient — men in-
vented ‘ iu1·a,' and stamped those actions
as ‘iniusta' Notice the Lueretian phrase
‘ fateare necesse ests

112. tempora fastosque: the two
words mark the points in history which
are here relevant— dates and orderly
succession. It is a question of chron-
ology, which of the two came first, ‘ ius '
or ‘ iniustum.’

113. nee . . . nee, ‘ as not‚' ⁶ so not.'
As the line that separates thejust and un-
just is not one of nature’s (lrawing‚ so

It is a variation of philosophy will not persuade us that it is

a hard and fast line, admitting no shades
or varieties on either side of it.

1 14. bona, ἀγαθά, ‘ things advantage-
ous‚' not in a moral sense.
