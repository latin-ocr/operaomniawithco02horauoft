LIB. Ι. SAT. 10.

tragedy to Pollio, epos to Varius, bucolics to virgil. Satire seemed what 1
might try and do better than Varro Atacinus and others, though confessing
my inferiority to Lucilius. Ι don‘t dispute the garland with him?

50—71. You say I speak of the ‘turbid stream that often carried much rubbish.’
Well, do you find nothing to criticize in Homer? Did not Lucilius in
Accius and Ennius? Why may we not think that Lucilius was too hasty?
Give him all credit as more finished than you would expect, than his pre—
decessors. Still if he lived now he would find much to correct ; he would be
more exacting in his criticism.

72—92. What is to be worth reading must have eost much pains, and not be
written for the multitude. You may look to have your poenis read in bad
schools. That is not my ambition. I arn like Arbuscula 3 if the front stalls
admire, the pit and gallery may be hanged. I care for the approbation of
true poets and true critics, not for that of the poetasters and drawing-room

critics of the moment.

The verses enclosed in brackets are found in some of the 10th cent. MSS. (φ ψ λ
l β), but they were absent from Cruquius’ Bland. MSS„ and were certainly unknown
to the Scholiasts, who not only do not comment on them, but evidently found
‘Nempe incomposito,' ete. as the opening words of the Satn-e, ‘ Respondet his

of the more abrupt commencement that Persius, an imitator of Horace3 begins

Sat. 3 with ‘ Nempe.‘

[1 . Catone, apparently ‘ Valerius Cato‚'
a ‘grammarian’ and poet of the later
Republic, who is described by Suetonius
(de grammaticis illustr. 2 and ΙΙ) as
having read Lucilius in the lecture-mom
of Philocomus. Orelli thinks that that
passage gave the suggestion of this
interpolation, the action attributed to
Cato ‘ emendare parat verSUS,' being due
to a misapplication of some earlier
words of Suetonius, who speaks not of
Cato, but of earlier grammarians as
editing and retouching (‘ diligentius re-
tractare’) the writings of older poets.
Valerius Cato, ace. to Suetonius, lost
his property whilst still a minor in
Sulla’s proscriptions, and lived to an
extreme old age. This would render it,
though not probable, possible that he
should be engaged in literary work at
the date that Horace wrote.

4. quo melior· vir et est, the read—
ing of β; but the majority of the older
MSS. read the line unmetrically without
‘ et‚' and the variations in others ‘adest‚'
‘hic est‚' ‘meliorque vir est‚' ‘est quo
vir melior,' indicate that ‘et' is only
one conjecture amongst many for reme-
dying a fault in the original copy.

illo. In the uncertainty of the author-
ship of the verses it may seem idle to
guess who this ⁶ grammaticorum equitum
doctissimus' is that is contrasted with
Cato. Ritter suggests that the person
imagined is Horace's own teacher Or—
bilius, of whom Suetonius says that in
early life ‘in Macedonia . . . equo me-
ruit.' If this is so we may perhaps
imagine further that the severe dis-
cipline of v. 5 is suggested by that which
has made Orbilius himself fam0us; see
Epp. 2. 1. 71.
