LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 10.

261

Novistine locum potiorem rure beato?

Est ubi plus tepeant hiemes, ubi gratior aura 15
Leniat et rabiem Canis et momenta Leonis,

Cum semel accepit Solem furibundus acutum?

Est ubi divellat somnos minus invida cura?

Deterius Libycis olet aut nitet herba lapillis?

Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere plumbum 20
Quam quae per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum?
Nempe inter varias nutritur silva columnas,

Laudaturque domus longos quae prospicit agros.

Naturam expelles furca tamen usque recurret,

due to the unusual form ‘domo’ for
‘domui' The abl. might be taken as
an abl. absol. ‘in placing a house,’ but
the sense is not so good. The only
other instance quoted of ‘domo’ dat.
is Cato, R. R. 134.

14. beato, ‘the charms of the country
are allowed. Do you know any town
house where they can be bettered ?’

15. tepeant hiemes. Horace has
primarily in mind his own Sabine retreat,
sor which, in Sat. 2. 3. 10, he claims
this merit ‘Si vacuum tepido cepisset
villula tectos Elsewhere he tells us that
in the cold of winter he went to the sea,
Epp. I. 7. 10. ‘The contrast here is
only between town and country. You
ean’t find more means of keeping your—
self warm in town than in the country.'

16. momenta. Probably as in Epp.
1.6. 4 ‘movements⁷; ‘the Lion when he
comes munds It has been also taken
as in Sat. 1. 1. 8 for a short space of
time, ‘the Lion's hour‚' or for ‘influence.'

17. furibundus: Od. 3. 29. 19
‘ stella vesani Leonis.' The adj. is
predicative, going closely with accepit.
It is the sun's heat that causes the mad-
ness.

19. Libycis lapilliS, tessellated
pavement of Numidian marble.

olet: perhaps with reference to the
practice of sprinkling the floors with
perfumeS.

20. tendit, rumpere: our momen-
tary sympathy is bespoken for the im—
prisoned water as though it were a
violation of nature. The water brought
to Rome by the aqueducts was distri-
buted over the city by pipes of lead or
earthenware.

22. nempe ε for the use of ‘ nempe '
where the speaker after asking a ques-

tion answers it himself with some irony
see on Sat. 2. 7. 80. ‘ Ι will answer the
questions '-you are so far from thinking
the gifts of the country worse than those
of the town, that your aim in building a
town house is to make it as much like a
country house as you can.

inter columnas, ‘within the peri-
style ' ; but with the suggestion that for
all the varied tints ofthe marble columns
the eye desired some of nature's columns,
some green trees.

nutritur, i.e. ‘is grown with care
and effort.' For the practice see note
on Od. 3. 10. 5, and cp. Tibull. 3. 3. 15
‘ nemora in domibus sacros imitantia
lucos;' see Mayor on Juv. S. 4. 6.

23. domus, ‘a town house with a
wide country view.' Cp. the view from
Maecenas' house on the Esquiline as de-
scribed in Od. 3. 29. 6-8.

24. expelles: this is the reading
of all the best MSS. including all the
Bland„ and it is given accordingly by
most recent edd. Orelli keeps to ‘ex—
pellas ' which had general possession of
the text before Bentley. With the sub-
junctive the constr. will be as in Od. 4.
4. 65 ‘ Luctere : multa proruet integrum
Cum laude victorem.' ‘Turn out (or
“try to turn out’')‚ if you will‚’ etc.
With the future it seems an instance of
the omission of the conditional particle:
see on Sat. Ι. Ι. 45. This use is more
common with the fut. perfect (as there)
than with the future simple. ‘Furca
expellere' is a proverbial expression.
Cic. ad Att. 16. 2. 4 ‘quoniam furcilla
extrudimus,’ Catull. 105. 2 ‘ Musae
furcillis praecipitem eiciunt.’ So in
Greek δικράνοις ὠθεῖν Lucian‚ Tim. 12.
Cp. Arist. Pax 637 δικροῖς ὠθεῖν [κε-
κράγμασιν]
