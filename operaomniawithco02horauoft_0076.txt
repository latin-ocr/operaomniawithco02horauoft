nigra. Celsus (6. 6. 7) distinguishes
two kinds ofeyesalve, one called τέφριον,
from its ashy colour. This and v. 49
are the only places where Horace speaks
of himself as suffering from this weakness
of the eyes, but he speaks as isit would
be recognized as characteristic by his
friends. Dina, who thinks that it is
only meant as a temporary effect of the
night in the marshes, recalls Hannibal⁷s
loss of an eye from inflammation in the
marshes of the Arno, Liv. 22. 2.

names see on Od. 2. 243.

by Porph. as taken from workers in
marble who test the finish of junctures
by passing the nail over them. So

be doubted in such cases whether ‘ut’=
‘ that,’ the verb understood being subj.‚
‘ to such an extent that no second person
is more so‚’ or ‘ as,' the verb being
indic„ ⁴ as no one else is in a greater de-
gree? The comparison of the constr.
of v. 41 ‘ quales neque candidiores
Terra tulit' is in favour of the latter.
For the position of ‘ non ' we may com-
pare ‘non qui ' in Epp. 1. 15. 28.

34. Fundos, hod. ‘Fondi,’ a town
five miles inland, and halfway (thirteen
miles from each) on the Via Appia, be-
tween Tarracina and F crmiae. The Aufi-
dia gens appears from Suet. Calig. 2 3 to
have been native to Fundi, although
some members of it attained office at
Rome.

praetore. Acron's note is ‘ prae·

torem pro magistratu dixit, id est
decemviro} and Heindorf quotes Cic.
de Leg. Agr. 2. 34 92 ‘cuin venissem
Capuam coloniam deductam L. Consi-
dio et Sext. Saltio. quemadmodum ipsi
loquebantur, praetoribus . . . Nam pri-
mum cum ceteris in coloniis duumviri
appellentur hi se praetores appellari
volebant.' Other details follow, of their
making their lictors carry ‘fasces' in-
stead of wands, etc. Fundi is named by
Festus as one of the ‘ Praefecturae' to
which the Praetor Urbanus sent yearly a
‘ Praefectus iuri dicundo,' an officer who
stood in the place of ‘ duumviri’ elected
by the people. Aufidius Luscus would
be the ‘ Praefectus! The more dignified
title of‘ Praetor ⁷ seems to be given to
him in derision, perhaps as assumed by

himself, as it was by the‘ duumviri’ at 4

at Rome, and even in ‘coloniae' and

‘municipia’ (Liv. 34. 7). The‘ latus ss

clavus,’ or broad purple stripe down the

front of the ‘tunica' (Sat. 1. 6. 28) was 3

the distinctive mark of the Senatorian τ
order. W'hether Aufidius had a right ς
to the ‘praetexta' may be a question.
