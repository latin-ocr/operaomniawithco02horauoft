,358 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Nostros et tenui deducta poemata fi10; 225
Cum speramus eo rem venturam ut, simul atque

Carmina rescieris nos fingere, commodus ultro

Arcessas et egere vetes et scribere cogas,

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales

Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique 230
Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae.

Gratus Alexandro regi magno fuit ille

Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis

Rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.

Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt 235
Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo

Splendida facta linunt.

Idem rex ille poema

Qui tam ridiculum tam care prodigus emit,
Edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellen
Pingeret, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera 240

225. tenui deducta filo, ‘with how
tine a thread the poems are spun.⁷ See
on Sat. 2. Ι. 4.

227. commodus : see on Od. 4. 8. 1.

²²9· est operae pretium : a formula
of transitiou from Ennius; see Sat. 2. 4.
63.

230. aedituos. Poets are the ἱεροφύ-
λακες of the temple raised to the ‘ virtus
Augusti.’ Cp. Virg. G. 3. 10 foll.

belli domique, with speetata3 cp.
Epp. 1. 20. 23.

232. ille Choerilus: A. P. 357. An
epic poet of Iasos in Caria who attached
himself to Alexander3 to be distinguished
from two othei· poets who bore the same
name: (Ι) an Athenian tragic poet B.C.
523—483, (Ἠ a Samian contemporary and
friend of Herodotus who wrote an epic
poem on the Persian war.

233. male natis: the opp. ‘bene nata,'
(Μ. 4. 4. 36, suggests that this means
· ill bred‚⁷ not the children of true poetic
spirit. See note on Od. 1. 27. 1 and add
Sat. 2. 3. 8, A. P. 122, 377. versibus
is the dat. after ⁶ rettulit acceptos'; ‘ set
down to the credit of his verses‚' ‘ owed
to them '; a phrase from book-keeping.
Ovid imitates, ‘Acceptum refero versibus
esse nocens’ Trist. 2. 10.

234. regale nomisma, ‘ from a
king's own mint.‘ He exalts the price,
as we might talk of ‘ broad gold pieceS.⁷

‘Philippi’ bore the name of the great
Philip, and were from the time of their
coinage the chief gold coin of Greece.
It is possible that Horace speaks as
knowing the coins and admiring them ;
‘ pieces worthy of a king.'

235—237. As you cannot handle black
fluids without getting stained, so you
can hardly have bad poetry written
about you without your reputation suf-
fering.

235. remittunt: Sat. 2. 4. 69, 2. 8.
53; ‘produce‚’ give you in return for
handling them.

237. linunt: Epp. 1. 19. 3ο ‘quern
versibus oblinat atris.’

239. edicto. Cicero refers to the
same story ad Fam. 5. 12. Plutarch
tells us that the best representations of
Alexander's person were those of Lysip-
pus, whom alone he allowed to take
him; also that Apelles drew him with
thunderbolts in his right hand.

240. alius Lysippo, ‘another than
Lysippus.' Epp. 1. 10. 20 ‘alium sapi-
ente.5

duceret aera, ‘mould the brass,' a
slight extension ofthe more usual constr.
of ⁵ ducere ' with an accus. of that which
is formed of the metal‚ as Virg. Aen.
7. 634 ‘leves ocreas lento ducunt ar-
gento.'
