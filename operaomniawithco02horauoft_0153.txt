 

LIB. ΙΙ.

SAT. 3. 141

Danda est ellebori multo pars maxima avaris;

Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.

Heredes Staberi summam incidere sepulcro:

Ni sic fecissent gladiatorum dare centum 85
Damnati populo paria atque epulum arbitrio Arri,

Frumenti quantum metit Africa.
Seu recte hoc volui, ne sis patruus mihi?
Hoc Staberi prudentem animum vidisse.

‘Sive ego prave
Credo
‘Quid ergo

Sensit cum summam patrimoni insculpere saxo 90
Heredes voluit ?' Quoad vixit credidit ingens

82. ellebori, ‘hellebore’ <Helleborus
orientalis, Linnaeus) was held a specific
for mental maladies, Plin. N. H. 25. 5.

pars maxima: as to those whose
madness is the maddest.

83. nescio an, ⁴ I am pretty sure.'

Anticyram omnem, ‘ the whole store
of Antiey1a'; see below v. 106 and A. P.
300 ‘ tribus Anticyris caput insanabile?
The Anticyra where Strabo tells us the
best hellebore grew, and there was a
‘cure' for madness. was in Phocis on
the ‘ Crissaeus sinus ’; see A. P. l. c.

84. summam. sc. ‘hereditatis' Sta-
berius is quoted as an extreme instance
of the value attached to money; he
eared for the posthumous reputatiun of
having had it.

85. eentum paria: a hundred pairs of
gladiators would be an unusually large
number.

86. damnati: a proper legal use sor
an obligation imposed by the terms of
a wi11; the phrase used would be
‘ damnas esto dare . . .'

epulum, ‘ a funeral feast.'

arbitrio Arri, ‘ such as Arrius would
order⁷: the reference is to a famous
funeral feast which Q. Arrius (Cic. in
Vatin. 12 solli had given in honour of
his father. Cicero speaks of ‘many
thousands ³ having been entertained at it.

87. frumenti, a third obligation,
viz. a ‘frumentatio’ or general dis-
tribution of corn. The hyperbolic-al
description of the amount is like Od.
1. 1. 10 ‘quicquid de Libycis verritur
areis.’ Bentley, offended at the as-yn-
deton, proposed to read in v. 81
‘Arri et) Heindorf proposes ‘Fru-
menti et.’

88. ne sis patruus mihi, ‘do not
come the uncle over me’; see on Sat.
2. 2. 97. These words are suggested

as Staberius' answer to any one of his
heirs who criticiscd his conditions. Ster-
tinius goes on to throw his shield over
Staberius 2 he was acting with foresight
and consistency.

ne sis. This is one of the exceptions
allowed by Madv. (Opusc. 2. p. 105)
to the rule that in prohibitions ad-
dressed to a definite person writers of
the classical age used the perf. snbj.
not the pres. snbj. Mr. Postgate in the
Journal of Philology (vol. 18. p. 326)
suggests that ‘ne sis patruus.' though
apparently addressed to a definite person,
is the application in a particular in—
stance osa proverbial saying like Cicero's
‘actum ne agas’ ad Att. 9. 18. 3. of
which Madv. l. c. gives that explanation.
But see on Sat. 2. 5. 17.

89. hoe . . . vidisse. Orelli, Diint-
zer, and others throw the emphasis on
prudentem3 ‘ I imagine in making this
provision Staberius showed a farseeing
mind.' without raising the question
whether ‘vidisse' could be so used by
Horace, this seems forbidden by the
relative places of ‘hoc' and ‘pruden-
tem.’ The emphasis must surely be
on the first of the two, It may be still
doubted what ‘hoc' refers to. Hein-
dorf takes it of the attitude of the heirs
which has been assumed in Staberius’
words. Perhaps it may be better taken
of the explanation to follow in vv.
94 f. ‘ This I imagine is what Staberius
looked forward to.' An interlocutor is
supposed to interrupt with ‘Quid ergo
sensit‚' etc. ‘What do you mean he
perceived?' ‘sensiu⁷ lveing an echo of
‘vidisse'z for ‘ergo’ in an impatient ques-
tion, cutting short or implying doubt of
what has just been said, cp. V. 156.

01. quoad, a monosyllable, as always
in Lucretius : so ⁶ prout ' Sat. 2. 6. 67.
