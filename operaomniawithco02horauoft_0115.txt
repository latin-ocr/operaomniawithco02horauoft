Defingit Rheni luteum caput, haec ego ludo,

‘optimus atque Fuscus' v. 82 of this
Satire. The arguments, which are strong
for taking ‘ optimus' in these cases with
the following name, do not apply equally
here. It is more usually taken with
‘ Pedius.’ Those who believe that the
two were brothers sometimes (as Diur.)
take it ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with both. Very
possibly the additional name is intended
to recall the pure Roman descent to
which they are truc in their native Ro-
man speech. The cognomen of Pub—
licola belonged to the Valeria gens and
so to Messalla. Cp Virg. Catal. 11 (ad
Messallam) 40 ‘Messallis Publicolis?
It may have belonged to Pedius either,
according to the Scholiasts' theory, as
a member by birth of the Valeria gens
or, as Estte suggests, on the female
side from the Valeria who married Q.
Pedius.

30. Canusini . . . bilinguis. The
Schol. tells us that both Ennius and
Lucilius had given the title ‘ bilingues'
to the ‘Bruttates' or ‘ Bruttii,' doubt-
less in the same sense, as speaking Greek
as well as the native Italian dialect.
For Canusium see Sat. 1. 5. 91, 92

recall proverbs of similar import, ’γλαῦκ

36. turgidus Alpinus. Aer. has
a note, ‘Vivalium quendam poetam Gal-
lum tangit? Cruquius had suggested
for‘ Vivalium’ ‘rivalemss but Bentley
ingeniously altered it to ‘Vivaculumss
the form which Acron on Sat. 2. 5. 41
writes for Bibaculum. This key given,

the two passages explain one another.
They are both satires on M. Furius Bi-
baculus, a poet of the previous genera-
tion, whom Quintilian (10. 1. 96) classes
with Catullus and Horace as a writer
of‘ iambi,' and whom Tacitus (Ann. 4.
34) puts with Catullus, as one whose
writings, ‘referta contumeliis Caesarum‚'
were still read. ‘Gallum’ is probably
a misunderstanding of ‘Alpinus‚⁷ as it
would hardly be used of his birthplace
in Cisalpine Gaul, Cremona. The nick-
name ‘Alpinus,' ‘poet of the Alps‚' is
due to his verse parodied in Sat. 2. 5.
41 ‘ Iuppiter hibernas cana nive conspuit
Alpes,’ or possibly to fuller descriptions
in the same vein of Alpine scenes (as
the ⁴ Rheni caput') occurring in the poem
on the Gaulish wars (‘ pragmatia belli
Gallici ’> which Acron attributes to him.
‘ Turgidus ’ probably means ‘ bombastic,⁷
though it is tempting to parallel it with
‘ pingui tentus omaso ’ in Sat. 2. 5. His
personal habits were part os the tradi<
tion of him ; cp. Pliny N. H. praef.
‘ qui Bibaculus erat et vocabatur.'
iugulat. . . Memnona, i. e. writes of
Achilles slaying Memnon, the subject of
the Aethiopis ofArctinus, the cyclic poet.
‘Iugulat,' a rough word, of his elownish
way of ⁶ despatching ⁹ his hero.

37. defingit luteum caput seems a
continuous metaphor—‘ gives his Rhine
a head- piece of brown mud’ Conington;

‘defingere’ is a rare w ord, perhaps one
used, as is suggested, of rough, offhand,
workmanship. Probably the point lies
in Bibaculus having used the epithet

‘’luteum of the source of the Rhine.
Did he know enough of the upper
courses of the Alpine rivers to apply the
epithet purposely2 In any case it was
prosaic; but Horace probably figured
the source of the Rhine or Ixhone as
Virgil would have figuied it in the hall
