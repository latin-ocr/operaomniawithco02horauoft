HORATII EPISTULARUM

Coeperis, aut tineas pasces taciturnus inertes,

Aut fugies Uticam aut vinctus mitteris Ilerdam.

Ridebit monitor non exauditus, ut ille

Qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum 15
Iratus: quis enim invitum servare laboret?

Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem
Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.

Cum tibi sol tepidus plures admoverit aures,

1 2, 13. ‘Yon will be left in the book—
cases to get wormeaten, or even be sent
abroad for provincial readers‚’ i. e. you
will cease to be read by the only public
Ι care for, viz. the ‘ingenui' (Epp. 1.
19. 343 of Rome.

12. tineas pasees. Cp. ‘ Blattarum
ac tinearum epulae ' Sat. 2. 3. 119.

taciturnus, ‘ your voice will be
hushed.’

inertes: the disparaging epithet of
the bookworms adds to the sense of the
spiritless existence of their victim. It is
taken both as ‘ sluggish ’ (Orellil, and in
its etymological sense ‘ barbarous ' (‘sine
artibus Ἴ ; see on Epp. 2. 2. 126, A. P.

recurs to the figure of a slave. The
two places named, Utica near Carthage,
and Ilerda (hod. Lerida), stand for
second rate towns in Africa and Spain.
Note that when he is speaking without
suspicion of irony Horace counts the
fact that a book is read across the sea
a proof os excellence, whether generally
(A. P. 345), or in his own case (see Od.
2. 20. 17—20).

14. monitor non exauditus: the
poet himself, whose wamings have not
been listened to.

ut ille ε as the man in the fable.
This explains also the tense of pro-
trusit. The fable is not found else-
where.

16. Cp. A. P. 467.

17, 18. ‘ The second childhood of the
book will be when it becomes a read—
ing—book in the schools of low degree.'

17. elementa: Sat. 1. 1. 26.

18. extremis in vicis: schools in the
outskirts ofthe city. It answers to ‘ vili-
bus in ludis ' in the parallel expression,

balba: the stammering accents of

boys at a reading lesson are likened to
old age ‘ sans teeth.' For the use of
poetry in teaehing pronunciation see
Epp. 2. 1. 126 ‘Os tenerum pueri bal-
bumque poeta figurat.’ Juvenal tells us
that in his time Horace had become
a school-book> 7. 226 ‘cum totus de-
color esset Flaccus, et haereret nigro
fuligo Maroni.'

19 foll. A last word; the prophecy
of warning is over, and it is taken for
granted that the book is to be given to
the world. ‘When you find an audi-
ence tell them something of the author‚’
says Horace, and gives the book the
means of fulfilling his command. The
transition to v. 19 is abrupt, and the
exact meaning of the verse uncertain.
Is Horace speaking os the ‘recitation'
of his book when published? If so,
tepidus sol will perhaps be best taken
with Ritter for a time of year neither
too hot nor too cold for gathering
a good audienee. Contrast Juvenal’s
horror of ‘Augusto recitantes mense
poetas’ (S. 3. 9). Or is aures only a
figurative expression for readers? So
Orelli; comparing ‘tepidus sol' with
Martial's ‘hora libellorum Decima est,
Eupheme‚ meorum' (10. 19. 18), i. e.
‘my poems will be read after dinner.’
Or are we to think of a reader to a
group in the streets? or of men loiter-
ing, like Horace (Sat. 1. 6. 113), in the
afternoon by booksellers’ stalls, and
taking up a copy of his book (wilkins)?
A more serious change of meaning is
made if with Schiitz we follow the
Scholiast in taking the verse and those
that follow as a continuation of the
picture of Horace as a school-book.
The Scholiast interpreted ‘tepidus sol’
of the time of day, with the odd
note that boys are more manageable
(‘ tractabiliores ³) in the afternoon.
Modern editors, who follow them, amend
this by taking it of the time of year
