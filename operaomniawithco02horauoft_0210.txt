198 HORATII SATIRARUM

tronomic art, but the results are shown iu paradoxes, not in perfection. There
is display and yet meanness (cp. A. Ρ. 374, 375). The sketches of the four
‘scurrae' are drawn in a few strokes. Vibidius the hard drinker and Balatro
the buffoon‚ both presuming on their relation to the great man to quiz or
patronize the host. Nomentanus and Porcius (sor their names see on v. 23) playing
to Nasidienus, and making the most of their own supper. It will be noticed that
Maecenas is not mentioned.

The affectation of gastronomie preciseness in this Satire will be compared
with the fourth Satire. It is perhaps meant as a specimen of the kind of talk

at supper-tables which moved Horace's spleen, and which he laughed at more
elaborately in that Satire.

Verses 1-5. Is. ‘ How did you enjoy Nasidienus* supper? Ι heard you were there)
F. ‘ Vastly.'
H. ‘ Tell me the order of proceedings.'

6-9. F. ‘ F irst there came a wild boar, and our host told us all about it ; where

it came from, and when it was killed. It was garnished with salad and things
os piquant flavour.

10—17. ‘ Then a bustling page wiped the maple table with a purple eloth, while
another gathered up the fragments, when enter a solemn procession‚ an
Indian slave carryIng Caecuban wine, a Greek slave with Chian. The

host asked Maecenas if he would prefer Alban or F alernian3 both were in
the house!

18, 19. Η. ⁴ Alas for the sorrows of wealth ἔ But who were your party ?’

20—25. F. ‘On one conch myself‚ Viscus, and Varius; on the next Maecenas and
his two ‘⁴ umbrae,'⁷ Servilius Balatro and Vibidius ; on the third the host
in the middle, Nomentanus on one side of him, Porcius on the other. N omen-

tanus was so placed in order to point out to Maecenas the secrets of the
banquet.

25-33. ‘ Most of us were hopelessly puzzled, as Ι soon found. Meanwhile the host

leetured us on the proper time to pick apples. Yon must ask him what the
reasons were.

33—41. ‘ Vibidius, determined to take out his revenge, asked for larger cups, which
made our host turn pale. He dislikes hard drinkerS‚ probably because
their tongues are too free, or their palates too dull. At the suggestion all
filled the new cups except the two parasites of the house.

42—53. ‘ Then came a lamprey in a big dish garnished with shrimp sauce. The
host told us of its condition and how the sance was composed.

54—74. ‘At this moment the awning fell on the table with clouds of dust, frighten-
ing us all. The host put down his head and cried. Nomentanus consoled him.
The more courteous guests tried to stifle their laughter. Balatro, with mock
sympathy‚ tried to encourage him.

75-78. ‘ Nasidienus rose and left us, and we fell to whispering.'

79, 80. Η. ‘ What sport3 and what was the next scene? ’

80—95. F. ‘Vibidius calling again for wine3 the company finding excuse for
laughter. Presently Nasidienus comes back with his sels-possession restored,
more slaves bearing a huge charger filled with divers delicaeies, not bad
in themselves, bnt rendered unendurable by the host's discourse upon them.
We avenged ourselves by going away without tasting them.'
