EPIST. 18.

Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,

Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures, 70
Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.

Non ancilla tuum iecur ulceret ulla puerve

Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae

Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat. 75
Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam aspice, ne mox
Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.

Fallimur et quondam non dignum tradimus: ergo

Quem sua culpa premet, deceptus omitte tueri,

Ut penitus notum, si temptent crimina, serves 80
Tuterisque tuo fidentem praesidio: qui

Dente Theonino cum circumroditur, ecquid

Ad te post paulo ventura pericula sentis?

Nam tua res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet,

Et neglecta solent incendia sumere vires 85

the precept would seem rather wide of
the special mark.

70. patulae. The metaphoris meant
to convey the idea that like a large-
mouthed vessel, as it is easy to pour into
it, so it is easy to pour out again.
Cp. the somewhat similar metaph.
‘ rimosa . . . aure’ sat. 2. 6. 46.

71. emissum: A. F. 390 ‘nescit vox
missa reverti.‘ There is probably a
reminiscence of Homer's ἔπος φύγεν
’έρκος ὀδόντων Il. 4. 350, etc.

72. nonuleeret. For the substitution
of‘ non ’ with the potential for ‘ ne ’ with
a jussive subj. see note on Sat. 2. 5. 91.
Here notice that ‘non ' goes especially
with ‘ulla‚⁷ the separation of the two at
the beginning and end of the clause em-
phasizes both.

73. marmoreum venerandi.
suggestion of the epithets is that it is
like coveting what you see in a temple.

75. beet, in an ironical sense, ‘ make
you a present of the slave and think he
has made you a happy man‚' as though
he had given you all you could expect
from him.

incommodus, ifhe is disobliging.

76. commendes, ‘ introduce.' Cp.
Horace’s own cantion in this matter,
Epp. 1. 9, 1. 12. For his introduction
to Maecenas by Virgil and Varius see
Sat. 1. 6. 54.

78. quondam, ‘sometimes,’ Od. 2.

The

10. 18, Sat. 2. 2. 82.

tradimus: Epp. 1. 9. 3.

80. ut: perhaps rightly taken by
Orelli and Ritter and Schiitz as final.
‘ Remember that we are liable to make
mistakes. Be ready therefore to aban-
don one who proves unworthy in order
that you may keep your power to pro-
tect one who is slanderously attaeked.⁷
Dillr. follows the Scholiasts in taking
it for ‘just a5‚’ followed by a proper
hypothetieal sentence.

82. dente Theonino, evidently means
the ‘ tongue of slander,' but nothing is
known of the origin of the expression.
Porph. says, ‘ Theon quidam illo tem-
pore rabiosae dicaeitatis fuit‚’ and the
Scholiasts call him ‘ Luthienus (2) Theon,
libertinus‚' and tell a story of his
offending his patron by the bitterness of
his tongue, so that he was turned out of
the house.

circumroditur, The metaphor is
common, Od. 4. 3. 16; Sat. 1. 4. 81, 1.
6. 463 Epp. 1. 16. 38, 2.1. 151.

ecquid sentis: cp. ‘ecquid sentitis
in quanto contemptu vivatis’ Liv. 4. 3,
‘Have you any feeling2' ‘surely you
have some seeling‚' ‘ sor (the next line
continues) you ought to have, your own
safety is at stake when the fire has
reached the wall that adjoins your
house.’
