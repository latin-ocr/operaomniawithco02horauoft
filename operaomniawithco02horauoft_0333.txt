making up to schoolmasters.

way.

The Epistle is a defence of his Epodes and Odes 1-3‚ against the criticism of de-
tractors. It is addressed to Maecenas, both as the representative of the sair and wise
eritics, whose judgment he values (Od. 1. 5. 35, Sat. 1. 10. 81 foll.)‚ and contrasts
with that of the tasteless, and also as the patron and friend (Epp. 1. 1. 1), to whom

the first Epistle of the Book and the last but one are inscribed on the same
principle that is observed in Od. 1. 1. and 3. 29, the last Epistle being reserved, as
Od. 3. 30, for his own anticipations of personal fame.

PRISCO si credis, Maecenas docte, Cratino,
Nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt

Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus.

Ut male sanos

Adscripsit Liber Satyris Faunisque poetas,

Vina fere dulces oluerunt mane Camenae. 5
Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus3

Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma

1. Maecenas docte: Od. 3. 8. 5
'¹ docte sermones utriusque linguae.' The
epithet has its immediate place as
justifying the learned reference to Crati-
nus, ‘ As you know, as well as I'; but
it gives also the ground of his appeal to
Maecenas on the whole matter, as the
critic whose judgment he values most.
Cp. Od. Ι. 1. 35 ‘si me lyricis vatibus
inseres‚' and the tone of Sat. 1. 10. 78—

Cratino: Sat. 1. 4. 1. Aristophanes
charges him with intemperance, and
Plutarch (Symp. 2. 1) speaks of him as
having jested upon it himselfin his play
Πυτῖνη (the Flagon). The nearest
reference to the passage which Horace
had in mind is in the Epigram attri-
buted to Nicaenetus Samius (Biunck.
vol 1. p. 117) οἶνός τοι χαρίεντι πέλει
ταχὺς ιππος ἀοιδῷ Ι ὕδωρ δὲ πίνων οὐδὲν
ἂν τέκη σοφόν Ι ταῦτ’ ἔλεγεν, Διόνυσε,
και ἔπνεεν, οὐχ ἑνὸς ἀσκοῦ Ι Κρατῖνος,
ἀλλὰ παντὸς ὠδωδιὶς πίθου,

2. plaeere: Od. 4. 3. 24-

vivere: Od. 1. 32. 3, 4.9. 11.

male sanos: and so fitter to be‘ en-
listed' among Satyrs and Fauns, but, as
in the whole passage, there is an ironical
sels—depreciation in the epithet. It is
the world‘s view of poets, not their own.
Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 322, A. P. 295.

4. adscripsit. ‘Tanquam in legio-
nem suam: nam hoc verbum militare

1. 31, 2. 19. 4. The Fauns are their
Italian equivalents, A. P. 244, and re-
present the inspiration of native Roman
poetry. For Bacchus as god of poetry

6. arguitur vinosus, ‘is convicted

to Horace's love of such a collocation as
‘vini vinosus': cp. Sat. 2. 2. 39, Epp.
1. 18. 5, 89, A. P. 133. The reference
is to such passages as ll. 6. 261 ἀνδρὶ δὲ
κεκμηῶτι μένος με”γα οἶνος ἀέξει, and to
the frequent epithets μελιηδής, μελίφρων,
εὐήνωρ, κ.τ.λ.
