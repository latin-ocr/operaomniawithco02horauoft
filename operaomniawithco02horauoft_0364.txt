HORATII EPISTULARUM

Sub nutrice puella velut si luderet infans,

Quod cupide petiit mature plena reliquit.

100

Quid placet aut odio est quod non mutabile credas?
Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi.

Romae dulce diu fuit et sollemne reclusa

Mane domo vigilare, clienti promere iura,

Cautos nominibus rectis expendere nummos,

105

Maiores audire, minori dicere, per quae
Crescere res posset, minui damnosa libido.
Mutavit mentem populus levis et calet uno
Scribendi studio3 pueri patresque severi

Fronde comas vincti cenant et carmina dictant.

110

Ipse ego, qui nullos me adfirmo scribere versus

100. reliquit : the subj. is ‘Graecia.'

mature, ‘quieklyff

101. This verse reads naturally enough
as a summing up of the preceding lines,
⁴ so variable are the tastes of mankind ! ’
Any difficulty that has been felt arises
from the fact that v. 102 seems also
to sum them up and from a different
point of view. Keller follows Lach-
mann in thinking that the line was
misplaced and should come aster v, 107.
He finds it so placed in a MS. of value
(ν, Paris 9345). It would then be the
comment beforehand on the change of
mind at Rome: ‘ mutabile ’ leading to
‘mutavit . . . levis’ ; but see on v. 108.

102. paeeS‚ ‘times of peace' ; see on
Epp. Ι. 3. 8.

103. dulce: they asked no other plea-
sure.

sollemne : Epp. 1. 18. 49. The word
describes the Roman precision and
reverence for usage.

reclusa. domo: sor the purpose of
receiving and advising clients; see on
Od.4.5,54,Epp.1. 5. 31.

105. ‘To open the cash-box when
security is given and the borrower sol-
vent! ‘Cavere pecuniam,’ ⁶ to guarantee
money,’ was (as the edd. show), a
current legal phrase. nomnibus may
be the dat. after expendere, or the
modal abl. with cautos Cp. the use
of ‘nomina’ in Sat. 1. 2. 16. rectis,
‘ right,⁷ ‘ suitable‚' is a variation for the
usual ‘bonis’: cp. the saying of the
‘fenerator Alfius⁷ <quoted Epod. 2 in-
trod.) ‘ vel optima nomina non appel-
lando fieri mala.’

106. maiores audire, minori di-

cere, etc. The lines well describe two
characteristics of Roman morality, its
leaning on family tradition, and its close
relation to thrift (note that damnosa
means ‘ruinous to pocket,’ Epp. 1. 18.
21), but when read in the light of A. P.
323-332, where there is the same con-
trast of the Greek and Roman spirit
in respect of fitness for art and litera-
ture, we must see some irony in the
description. ‘ “ Serious business '³ which
is set up against literature, ends at
Rome sooner or later in money-getting
or money-sawng’

108. This is the place where it has
been proposed to insert v. 101: but it
is not needed. To say that all the
world changes its tastes would weaken
the force of ‘populus levis‚' the epithet
substituted for ‘gravis' the traditional
Roman characteristic. No one, Ι sup-
pose, will take Horace's description
‘ au pied de la lettre.‘

calet, of a sever. Orelli recalls Lu-
cian's description (Quomodo sit conscri-
benda historia 1) of the epidemic at
Abdera, which began with sever and
ended in a rage for spouting tragie
verses. Cp. also Juvenal’s ‘insanabile
. . . scribendi cacoethes ' S. 7. 52.

110. fronde, ‘leaves‚' not flowers;
leaves, that is, of bay or ivy, Od. 1. 1.
29, 3. 30. 16.

dictant, i.e. to an amanuensis; Sat.
1. . 10.

i4 11—113. For the arguments based
on these lines with regard to the date
of the Epistle see p. 329. The reference
is clearly to Epp. 1. 1. 10 ‘versus et
cetera ludicra pono.’
