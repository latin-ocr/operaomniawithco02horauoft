HORATII EPISTULARUM

Tu me inter strepitus nocturnos atque diurnos

Vis canere et contracta sequi vestigia vatum? 80
Ingenium sibi quod vacuas desumpsit Athenas,

Et studiis annos septem dedit insenuitque

Libris et curis, statua taciturnius exit

Plerumque et risu populum quatit; hic ego rerum
Fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis 85
Verba lyrae motura sonum connectere digner?

Frater erat Romae consulti rhetor, ut alter

79. tu me repeats the emphatic
¹ me ’ of v. 65. See note there.

80. eontracta, ⁴narrow,’ difficult to
tread in, and so requiring the undivided
attention which in the pre-occupation of
town life cannot be given. Cp. Prop.
3. 1. 14 ‘ non datur ad musas currere lata
via.’ Of the readings offered this seems
the most pmbable, but the text was un-
certain in the Scholiasts’ time. Porph.
gives ‘ contracta ' as a v. l.‚ reading him-
self with the majority of MSS. ‘con-
tacta! This Dillr. accepts, taking it
closely with ‘ sequi‚' to ‘follow and
tread in.' Schiitz complains with
reason that if this were the meaning it
should have been ‘ secutum contingere.'
V had ‘cantata' with the note ‘ab
aliis prius dictas which cannot stand.
Bentley would read ‘non tactas i. e.
which others have not trodden in; and
there have been many other conjec-
tures.

81-86. The connection of these lines
is not perfectly clear. Perhaps it is
‘think of the difference between the
trained genius and me. He perhaps
overdoes it, becomes a pedant and
misanthrope. But Ι, in the very oppo-
site of his peacesul lise, how can Ι try to
write lyric poetry if I have any sels-
respect left ’θ’ There is a tone of satire
in the description of the scholar's train-
ing which has suggested that Horace is
hitting some rival poet.

81. vacuas: so ‘ vacuum Tibur ’ Epp.
1. 7. 45 ; opposed in this point to busy
and crowded Rome.

82. septem. No reason is given for
the selection of ‘seven' It seems to
imply something much beyond the usual
time allowed sor an educational resi-
denee at Athens.

insenuit: cp. Epp. 1. 7. 85 ‘im—
moritur studiis et amore senescit ha-

bendi.'

83. curis : limited by the words that
accompany it, books and the cares they
bring with them. He is thinking of
composition. Some MSS. have ‘Curii,’
which Porph. read and took with ‘ statua‚'
imagining Curius to have been a man of
special taciturnity.

statua taciturnius ι
‘ infantes statuas)

exit, i. e. whenever he goes out into
the world.

84. plerumque, ‘ very osten?
on Sat. 1.10.15.

hie : at Rome, not at Athens.

ego: Ι, not the recluse scholar.

Sat. 2. 5. 40

See

85. Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 16 ‘ mersor civili-
bus undis?

86. ‘To string together words which
shall wake the lyre to music,’ i. e. to
compose lyric poetry. Cp. Od. 4. 9. 4
‘ verba loquor socianda chordis?

digner, ‘deignss He implies that
sels-respect prevents him. The word
introduces an unexpected note. So sar
as what has gone before has prepared
us, we should have looked rather sor
‘ coner‚’ which has been actually substi-
tuted in some MSS. The additional
colour of ⁴ digner' is due to what sol-
lows, to which the word is a link.
There is only one condition on which
verse written in this hubbub can gain
praise, and that is the humiliating con-
dition of joining a mutual admiration
elique.

87. frater erat ε the story which is to
illustrate such eliques is introduced
abrupdy, as that iu v. 26.

consulti, i.e. ‘ iurisconsulti’: Sat. 1. 1.
17, and inf. v. 159.

ut alter . . . audiret. On what does
‘ut' depend? In all cases which have
been quoted as parallels from Horace
himself, as Sat. 1. 1.95,1. 7. 13, Epp. 1.
