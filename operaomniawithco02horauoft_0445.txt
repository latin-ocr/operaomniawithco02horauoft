HORATII ARS POETICA.

429

Nullum ultra verbum aut operam insumebat inanem
Quin sine rivali teque et tua solus amares

Vir bonus et prudens versus reprehendet inertes,

445

Culpabit duros incomptis allinet atrum
Traverso calamo signum, ambitiosa recidet
Ornamenta‚ parum claris lucem dare coget,
Arguet ambigue dictum, mutanda notabit,

Fiet Aristarchus; non dicet:
Offendam in nugis?'

‘Cur ego amicum 450

Hae nugae seria ducent

In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.
Ut mala quem scabies aut morbus regius urget

443. nullum verbum insumebat
. . quin: Sat. z. 3. 42 ‘nil verbi pereas
quin fortiter addam.’

444. sine rivali . . . amares ε Cic.
ad Q. Fr. 3. S. 4 ‘ O dii, quam ineptus!
quam se ipse amans sine rivali !'

445. vir bonus et prudens : see on
Epp. 1. 16. 32. It is characteristic of
this Epistle that the moral phrases
familiar in the earlier ones have now
their application to the compos ition and
criticizing of literary vxmk. See p. 335.

inertes: see on Epp. 1. 20. 12, 2. 2.
126.

446. duros: see on Sat. 1. 4. 8 of
Lucilius, ‘ durus componere versus.'

incomptis: cp. ‘ incultis' of Choeri-
lus' verses in Epp. 2. 1. 233.

atrum. Not only because the ink
was black and the lines scored strongly,
but also in the metaphorica! sense Ξ
‘triste' as the ‘nigrum theta⁷ of the
judges’ mark of condemnation, Pers.

4 447. traverso: ‘in transversumducto'
Ι Comm. Cruq. The words are generally
explained of a mark similar to that
which was placed by critics opposite
suspected verses and called from its
shape ὅβελος, ‘ alter Aristarchus hos
[versiculos] ὀβελίζω’ Cic. Fam. 9. 10.
See Liddell and Scott, s. v.

ambitiosa. The Scholiasts interpret
‘superflua‚' in which case the adj. as
well as verb would be parallel to
‘luxuriantia compescet ’ Epp. 2. 2. 102.
But Quintilian uses the word of affected
ways of appealing to admiration, as
1 2. 10. 40 ‘ id esse affectationis et ambi-
tiosae in loquendo iactationis‚‘ and ΙΙ.
ῐ. 49, of an orator who in pleading a
case of lise and death uses a florid style
with metaphors and tricks of art, ‘ am-

bitiosum institorem eloquentiae.'

449. arguet, ‘convict.’

450. Aristarchus: the great Homeric
critic, who lived at Alexandria in the
2nd century Β. C. His name has become
proverbial. So Cicero in the passage
quoted on v. 447. Cp. also ad Att.
1. 14 ‘ meis orationibus quarum tu Aris-
tarchus esf

non: the MSS. are divided between

‘non’ and ‘nec' 1 follow Bentley,
Orelli, and Munro.

452 derisum semel exceptumque
sinistre‚‘ one that has once been fooled
(cp.‘ derisor’⁷ v. 4333 and given this
illstarred receptionss i. e prais d sor
bad verses. This is the interpretation
of the Scholiasts and is that given by
Lambinus, and recent editors have re-
turned to it. Orelli would take the
words of the poet's being langhed down
and damned by the public. This however
gives a less easy connection with what
follows ; the ‘ mala ’ of this verse are to
be found in the picture, which begins in
v. 453, of what the habit of writing bad
verses unchecked by critic-ism ends in.
This is spoilt by the insertion of a bad
reception of his play in the theatre‚
or of his poem by the public. From
Horace’s point of view at the moment
this would be not a missortune‚ but
another chance of his salvation.

453-456. ‘ There is no more chance
for him. Mad in selfconceit, he is like
a man with some dreaded malady: every
man of sense gets out of his way, boys
tease him, and fools make his train.'

453. morbus regius, the jaundice.

. Horace may have supposed it to be in-

fectious‚ or he may mean that the un-
natural colour which it causes would
srighten people. The name is a tech-
