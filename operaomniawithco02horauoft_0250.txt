HORATII EPISTULARUM

Si melius quid habes arcesse vel imperium fer.
Iamdudum splendet focus et tibi munda supellex.
Mitte leves spes et certamina divitiarum ⁷

Et Moschi causam: cras nato Caesare festus

Dat veniam somnumque dies;

impune licebit 10

Aestivam sermone benigno tendere noctem.
Quo mihi fortunam, si non conceditur uti?
Parcus ob heredis curam nimiumque severus

Adsidet insano.

vicinus' Comm. Cruq., ‘vicus olim et
locus in agro Falerno’ Aer. Horace
defines the locality, but more cannot be
known. ‘ Between Minturnae (at the
mouth of the Liris) and Sinuessa' (a
dozen miles eastward along the coast)
would be in the near neighbourhood of
the Mons Massicus.

6. arcesse, ‘send for it,’ ie. bid it
be brought from your own house to
mine.

imperium fer : ‘ patere me regem esse
convivii ' Comm. Cruq. ; ⁶ submit to my
ordering.’

7. splendet focus, both ofthe hearth‚
cleaned for the occasion, and the ‘ reni-
dentes Lares ' (Epod. 2. 65 n.) by it.

8. leves : they seem trifles to-day.

certamina divitiarum, ‘ wealth with
its rival1·ies.’ ‘Noli curare de divitiis
quibus certamus anteire ditiores ’ Schol.
Cp. Sat. 1.1. 113 foll.

9. Moschi causam. Some famous
cause in which Torquatus was engaged.
The Scholiast says that Moschus was a
‘ rhetor ³ from Pergamum who was tried
for poisoning.

nato Caesare. Suetonius (Aug. 57)
says ‘ equites Romani natalem eius
sponte atque consensu biduo semper
celebraveruntf and Horace's supper-
party the night before seems to have
the sarne purpose.

10. veniam somnumque: licence for
holiday and for longer sleep than usual,
so that we need not sear a late revel
to—night.

11. aestivam. The word is used
with some latitude, for Augustus’ birth-
day was A.D. ix Kal. Oct. (Sept. 23l.
This has been felt to be a serious diffi-
culty and various modes of escape have
been sought. (1) Meineke, Haupt, and
Munro, following one or two later MSS„
read ‘Festivam.' This is objected to,

Potare et spargere flores

apart from its small authority, on the
ground that the antithesis ‘festus dies,⁷
‘ festivam noctem ' is cold and not Hora-
tian. (2) Others suppose it to be the
birthday of Julius Caesar (July 12) or
(Ritterl of Gaius Caesar the elder son
of Julia and Agrippa, who was born in
the summer of B.C. 20. ‘ Caesar ' is used
without further designation for C. Jul.
Caesar in Od. 1. 2. 44 and Sat. 1. 9. 18,
but in both cases the context makes the
use ofit clear. Everywhere else it is the
name of Augustus and can hardly but be
so here.

1 2. fortunam. It is difficult to decide
between ‘ fortunam' and ‘ fortuna'; good
MSS. are divided. The Bland. had ¹ for-
tuna ': but the exehange of‘ a ' (= ‘ am ')
and ‘a ' is easy. The schol. of Acron ‘ ad
quid mihi dederunt dii fortunam,’ though
not conclusive, points to his having
found ⁴ fortunam) On the possibility
of the ablative in this constr. see Con-
ington on Virg. Aen. 4. 98 ‘ quo nunc
ceitamine tanto?' The evidence for it
is doubtful. On the other hand the
accusative is amply supported not only
in cases (as Ov. Am. 2. 19. 7“ Quo mihi
fortunam quae nunquam fallere curet Ὢ),
where a similar doubt of reading might
arise. but in such cases as ibid. 3. 7. 49
‘ Quo mihi fortunae tanturn ¹? quo regna
sine usu'?’ where the metre excludes the
ablative. Cp. for a somewhat similar
ellipsis with the accus. Sat. 2. 5. 102
¹ unde mihi tam fortem ἲ ' 2. 7. i 16 ‘unde
mihi lapidem ’ἓ ’

13. ob heredis curam. For the feel-
ing cp. Od. 2. 3. 19, 2. 14. 25, 4. 7. 19,
with the notes on those passages.

14. adsidet: as we say, ‘ is next door
to ’; a metaph. use not found elsewhere;
though the opposite, ‘disside0,’ is com-
mon.

spargere flores. Od. 3. 19. 22
