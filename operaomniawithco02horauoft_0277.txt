LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 11.

Cunctane prae Campo et Tiberino flumine sordent?

An venit in votum Attalicis ex urbibus una, 5
An Lebedum laudas odio maris atque viarum?

‘ Scis Lebedus quid sit3 Gabiis desertior atque

Fidenis vicus3 tamen illic vivere vellem,

Oblitusque meorum obliviscendus et illis

Neptunum procul e terra spectare furentem.’ 10
Sed neque qui Capua Romam petit imbre lutoque
Aspersus volet in caupona vivere; nec qui

illusions. They lead the way, therefore,
in feeling to the question of v. 4, even
if they are not to be connected with it
grammatically as by Orelli and Dills.

4. sordent prae seems to mean
‘pale before: ‘in comparison with’;
Epp. 1. 18. 18.

5. venit in votum: see note on
‘ esse in votis ' Sat. 2. 6. 1.

Attalicis urbibus. The splendid
legacy of the last of the Attali (see on
Od. 1. 1. 12, 2. 18. 4) had so struck the
imagination of Horace, if not of his
countrymen generally, that ‘Attalicus⁷
carries with it here, besides having its
proper sense of ‘belonging to the old
kingdom of the Attali⁷ tin other words,
to the Roman province of Asia> the ad-
ditional idea of princely wealth and
luxury.

6. Lebedum. Lebedus, fifteen miles
N.W. of Colophon on the Caystrius
Sinus, had been one of the twelve cities
of Ionia, but about B.C. 300 was nearly
desolated by Lysimachus, who transferred
the population to Ephesus. It seems to
stand here for some place in which only
a tired traveller⁷s caprice could lind at—
traction.

odio maris atque viarum: as Od.
2. 6. 7 ‘lasso maris et viarum.⁷

7—10. These lines seem to be rightly
treated by the Scholiasts as an imagined
apology of Bullatius for his strange
preference: ‘I do not deny that it is a
very dull place, but Ι could live there
for ever rather than go to sea again.'
It has been said that such a fragment of
unexpected dialogue belongs rather to
the style of the Satires than that of the
Epissses, but any harshness is much
lessened by noticing that the lines are
a dramatic illustration of the words that
precede, ‘odio maris atque viarum.’ Per-
haps we may compare Epp. 1. 15. 11
where ‘ Quo tendis‚' ete„ is an illustra-

tive expansion of ⁴ praeteragendus equus!
Cp. also Epp. 1. 16. 31 and 41, A. P.
7. Gabiis . . . atque Fidenis. The
two names stand together in Virg. Aen.
6. 773 among the list of Latin towns.
In Juv. S. 10. 100 they stand, after
Horace, as representatives of places
which have corne down in the world.
Cp. the epithet ‘simplicibus Gabiis’
Juv. S-3·192- In Epp. 1. 15. 9 Gabii
is spoken of as an unfashionable water—
ing-place. Cp. Juv. S. 7. 4.

9. Imitated by Pope ‘ Eloisa to Abel—
ard,⁷ 206 ‘The world forgetting, by
the world forgot.'

10. Bullatius is meant to recall the
famous Epicurean pleasure described by
Lucr. 2. 1 ‘Suave mari magno turban-
tibus aequora ventis E terra alterius mag-
num spectare laborem.' If Lebedus
can give no other pleasure it can give
that.

11. sed neque. This is Horace's
reply, ⁴ What you describe is very well
as a passing feeling—the result of cir-
cumstances of the moment—it is not
a principle to build your lise on.⁷

neque. . . nee . . . nec perhaps are
meant to recall some formula of the
schools (cp. Plin. Epp. 2. 20 ‘sufficiunt
duae fabulae, an scholastica lege tertiam
poscis ?') which required three instances
—but the third instance is so like the
actual case proposed that the construc—
tion resembles Od. 3. 5. 27 foll. ‘neque
amissos colores Lana refert medicata
fuco, Nec vera virtus, quum semel ex*
cidit, Curat reponi deterioribus‚' where
see note.

imbre lutoque aspersus, ‘drenched
with rain and bespattered with mud?

12. caupona: the inn is relatively
comfortable; but it is not home.

vivere, ‘to spend his lise!
