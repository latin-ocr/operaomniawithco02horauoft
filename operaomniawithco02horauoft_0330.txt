HORATII EPISTULARUM

Dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici:

Expertus metuit.

Tu, dum tua navis in alto est,

Hoc age, ne mutata retrorsum te ferat aura.
Oderunt hilarem tristes tristemque iocosi,

Sedatum celeres, agilem navumque remissi3

90

†Potores bibuli media de nocte Falerni
Oderunt porrecta negantem pocula, quamvis
Nocturnos iures te formidare tepores.

Deme supercilio nubem;

plerumque modestus

Occupat obscuri speciem, taciturnus acerbi. 95
Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos,

86. A reflection on the difficulties
suggested in the preceding lines and
leading to the exhortation which fol-
lows In ‘dulcis inexpertis . . . expertus
metuet' has Horace in mind the end of
Virg. Ecl. 3 ‘et quisquis amores Aut
metuet dulces aut experietur amaros? ’

87. dum tua navis in alto est, ‘as
you have embarked on this voyage.'

88. hoe age, ‘give all your atten-
tion? Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 152, Epp. 1. 6. 31.

89. Horace returns to the topic of
vv. 40 foll. of the necessity of some
harmony of humour and taste. show—
ing where he thought Lollius likely to
fail. In vv. 89, 90 he imagines two
alternative grounds of difference; but
v. 93 indicates that he expects Lollius
to show unreasonable gloorn‚ not un-
reasonable mirth.

91. This verse is of very doubtful
origin. It is not found in the text of
any of Keller’s best MSS. except σ
(St. Gall, put by him now in the 11th
cent). The Sclioliasts give no sign
of having read it, for the annotation
in Comm. Cruq., ‘ Oderunt, potulenti,'
means that ‘ Oderunt' stood in the text
without a subject, and the annotator
was suggesting the one which was to be
understood. There is also the objection
pointed out by Bentley that ‘ de nocte'
is used not in the Horatian sense (Epp.
1. 7. 88: cp. 1. 2. 32 and Sat. 2. 8. 3,
and see note on Epod. 13. 4) of some-
thing which begins before midnight‚ but
in the unclassical sense of that which is
prolonged to or past midnight. In the
parallel line which Horace, or his inter-
polator, is meaning, Epp. 1. 14. 34,
untimely drinking is described by ‘ de

luce.’ It must be allowed on the other
hand that a subject is badly wanted
for ¹ Oderunt' in v. 92. Keller would
have us supply ‘ porrigentes pocula,' but
such an ellipsis following the balanced
phrases of vv. 89. 90 does not seem
likely. It has been proposed to mend
this by ejecting not the whole of v. 91,
but from ‘ bibuli ' to ‘ oderunt,’ reading
‘ Potores porrecta negantem pocula!
This makes excellent sense, but it is then
very hard to account for the double
process of corruption, the substitution
of a second ‘Oderunt' for ‘Potores,’
and then the restoration of ‘Potores’
with the rest of the interpolated line.
If the line be retained ‘ bibuli ’ must be
taken as governing ‘ Falerni‚’ as in Epp.

9Ξ. tgpores: a word not found else-
where until late Latin for ‘feverish-
ness.' Orelli would therefore with the
authority of one MS. substitute ‘va-
pores.

94. plerumque, ‘very often’3 see on
Sat. 1. 10. 15.

95. occupat speeiem, ‘puts on the
guise‚' is thought, though he has no
claim to' be so.

obscuri, ‘ dark,’ ⁴ designing ' ; ‘ non
aperti, non simplicis, non ingenui. ver-
suti potius, obscuri, astuti' Cic. Off. 3.

qualities into vices, Sat. Ι. 3. 55 foll.

96. inter cuneta, ‘through all this!
‘After all, what we have been talking
of touches the outside of life only3 you
will not forget, I am sure, the more
important inside.'
