HORATII EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE XI.

TO BULLATI US.

Verses 1-10. YOU have been visiting all the famous and beautiful places on the
coast of Asia. well, what do you think of them? Do you think Rome
beats them all? or have you a hankering for one of the towns of Attalus'
old kingdom ¹? or have you an enthusiasm for even Lebedus as an alternative
to further travelling on the sea?

11-20. But travelling is not the business of life. It is good for those who are
siekf in mind or body. Those who are not do not need it, and should be
content to praise the sights of foreign lands but spend their lives at home.

21—50. Enjoy what you have. Our modern restlessness does not, diminish care.
What we need is a well-balanced mind.

The occasion is a visit of Bullatius to places of interest on the coast of Asia
Minor, places of which Horace speaks with the air of one who has himself seen
them (see on Sat. Ι. 7). Bullatius is apparently to be thought of as still in the
East (see on v. 21), perhaps as having written a letter, to which this is an answer,
with some traveller’s raptures on the beautiful places he is visiting. The substance
of the Epistle is an indictment of foreign travel as a form of the restlessness of the
age. The feeling which finds definite expression here is to be traced in many
passages of the Odes. It is part of the motive of Od. Ι. 3—Horace wishes Virgil
a happy voyage, but ‘ non invidet, miratur magis: ' of Od. 1. 7—-he agrees with
Plancus that Rhodes and Mytilene do not make up for banishrnent from Tibur,
even though he preaches for the occasion patience under it: of Od. 2. 6—‘ Septi—
mius⁷ friendship would stand the strain of any traveL but may it not be put to such
a strain! “ Sit modus lasso maris et viarum.’' It is more plainly put in Od. 2. 16.
18 foll„ which should be specially compared with this Epistle.

Nothing is known of Bullatius. It is possible that he visited the East in the
train of Tiberius: see introd. to Epp. Ι. 3.

QUID tibi visa Chios, Bullati, notaque Lesbos,
Quid concinna Samos, quid Croesi regia Sardis,
Smyrna quid et Colophon, maiora minorave fama?

1. Quid tibi visa Chios. 'Phe-plna&
⁴ What thought you of Chios?y so Cicero,
‘quid tibi videor' ad Div. 9. 21. 2; so
in Greek τί σοι φαίνεται ὁ νεάνισκοςς

3. maiora minorave fama. For
the difficulties of text and interpretation
which encompass these words see note
at the end of the Epistle. With our

 

Plat. Charm, 4, etc. Cp. also ‘ Lebedus
quid sit,’ infr. v. 7.

2. concinna, ‘ trim,’ ⁵ pretty.' It
must be meant of the city rather than
the island.

Sardis represents the Greek Σάρδεις
(the form is noted as a plural by Pris-
cian, 7. 17. 85): regia is therefore in
apposition—-‘ Croesus' royal home.’

reading and punctuation they are per-
haps best taken as the qualification, in
the first place, of ¹ Smyrna et Colophon‚'
‘ places greater, or it may be less, than
the world thinks them‚' but as intended
to be carried back in sense to the places
characterized before, and to convey a
hint of depreciation— the tone of a tra-
veller who has himself outgrown some
