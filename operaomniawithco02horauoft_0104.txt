HORATII SATIRARUM

Accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tanturn,
Arreptaque manu, ‘Quid agis, dulcissime rerum?’
‘ Suaviter, ut nunc est,‘ inquam, ‘ et cupio omnia quae vis.’ 5

Cum adsectaretur: ‘Num quid vis?' occupo.
‘Noris nOS‚’ inquit; ‘docti sumus.’

Hoc‚’ inquam, ‘mihi eris.'

At ille

Hic ego, ‘ Pluris

Misere discedere quaerens,

Ire modo ocius, interdum consistere, in aurern
Dicere nescio quid puero, cum sudor ad imos 10

M anaret talos.

‘ O te, Bokme, cerebri

Felicem!’ aiebam tacitus, cum quidlibet ille

Garriret, vicos, urbem laudaret.

Ut illi

Nil respondebam, ‘Misere cupis,’ inquit, ‘abire;

3. accurrit . . . arrepta: both ex-
press the vehemence of his affected de-
light.

4. quid agis Ξ) ‘ how are you ⁴? ’ Epp.
1. 3. 15 ‘quid mihi Celsus agit 'P

dulcissime rerum. For the differ-
ence of gender see Madv. 5 310, obs. 1 ;
cp. Ov. Met. 8. 49 ‘ pulcherrime rerum’ :
‘ rerum ’ = ‘ in all the world.’ The
question has also been taken to be
‘quid rerum agis'? but ‘rerum' in
this inert sense could hardly stand at
the end of the verse; and the answer
‘ nicely ' would be inappropriate.

5. ut, nune est, ‘just now.' Orelli is
right in noticing that the point of the
answer is its conventionality. Horace
wishes to get rid of his interlocutor.
This bars any deeper meanings in ‘ut
nunc est,¹ which would have invited
further questioning.

cupio omnia quae vis, a formula of
politeness. Plaut. Pers. 5. 1. 14, Rud.
4. 4. 1.

O. adsectaretur. Note the force of
theb prep. and of the frequentative
ver .

num quid vis, ‘ can 1 do anything
more sor you Ῥ a formula of leave-tak-
ing. See Plaut. Aul. 2. 1.53 (Xl'agner's
note). and Donatus' note on Ter. Eun.
2. 3. 49 ‘abituri ne id dare facerent
numquid vis dicebant iis quibuscum con-
stitissent.’

occupo, i. e. before he could begin.
Epp. 1. 7. 66 ‘ occupat et salvere iubet

rior.’

Ρ 7. noris nos: taken by Aer. as an
answer to 'numquid vis'? ‘hoc volo
(ut) noris nos‚’ and so Dillr. and

Ritter. Orelli takes it independently,
‘you surely know.' This is the best
dramatically. It is the part of the
speaker to assume mutual acquaintance,
as it is Horace⁷s part politely to ignore
it. Note the force with this latter pur-
pose of the fut. ‘ eris.' Horace has not
known hitherto his literary tastes.

hie, inf. v. 26; Sat. 2. 2. 7, 2. 8. 16.

8. misere, inf. v.14; it is common
in the comic poets for ‘ vehementer?

10. puero. Even the master of a
modest household (see on Sat. 1. 3. 12,
1. 6. 116) had a slave 'k‘ pedisequus ’) in
attendance on him when he walked out.
Horace whispers in his ear as though
he had some private business which
good manners would compel his perse-
cutor to respect.

11. cerebri felicem; happy in the
power of flying into a passion and so
cutting such a knot. Horace is fettered
by his good breeding. Cp. ‘ cerebrosus ’
Sat. 1. 5. 21; ‘cerebrum’ is the seat
of the passion of anger in Plautus, Poen.
3. 2. 25, Bacch. 2. 3. 17. For the gen.
cp. Sat. 2. 2. 66 ‘cultus miser‚' Ov. Met.
5. 267 ‘Felices studiique locique,’ ‘in
respect of?

Bolanus (from Bola, a town of the
Aequi) is the name of a friend ofCicero,
ad Fam. 13. 77, and of a Roman
governor of Britain, Tac. Ann. 15. 3.
The person at whom Horace discharges
this Parthian dart is unknown.

14. misere cupis. This is possibly
an aside, like Horace’s words vv. 28 f.,
the man’s thoughts being put for him
into wordS. But it is more probably
intended as a joke, though it is the real
