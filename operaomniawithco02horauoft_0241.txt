LIB. I. EPIST. 2. 229
Non domus et fundus, non aeris acervus et auri
Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febres,
Non animo curas. Valeat possessor oportet,
Si comportatis rebus bene cogitat uti. 50

Qui cupit aut metuit, iuvat illum sic domus et res

Ut lippum pictae tabulae, fomenta podagram,

Auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes,

Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis acescit.

Sperne voluptates: nocet empta dolore voluptas. 55
Semper avarus eget: certum voto pete finem.

Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis:

Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni

Maius tormentum. Qui non moderabitur irae

Infectum volet esse dolor quod suaserit et mens, 60
Dum poenas odio per vim festinat inulto.

Ira furor brevis est: animum rege, qui nisi paret

Imperat ς hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catena.

Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister

47. Orelli points out that the three
things named, ‘ domus,' ‘ fundus‚' ‘ aeris
acervus‚' answer, in varied order, to the
three objects of desire mentioned in vv.
4 47—49. non . . . non. Another
illustration or argument from analogy.
As they do not restore bodily health, so
they do not mental.

48. deduxit. The aoristic use.
This line is an echo os Lucret. 2. 34,
where the general sense is the same,
‘Nee calidae citius decedunt corpore
febres,' etc. Cp. Od. 3. 1. 41 soll.

49. valeat. Health isa condition of
enjoyment. Cp. the emphatic position
of ‘valido' in Od.1.31.17.

51. sio ut, i. e. no more than.

52. fomenta. Usually explained
since Diintzer by Seneca de Prov. 9. 4,
which speaks of ‘fomenta subinde
mutata⁷ as a means practised by the
luxurious of keeping the feet warm, hot
flannels or the like. The argument is
‘if the organs of sense are diseased‚
that which ordinarily gives pleasure to
them ceases to do so.’ What gives
pleasurable warmth to a healthy foot
will give pain rather than pleasure to an
inflamed one. If ‘fomenta' were ex-
plained of applications used to relieve

the gout, there would be no parallel to
the other cases.

54. sincerum, ‘ clean‚’ Sat. 1. 3. 56.
For the thought of the line cp. Lucr. 6.
17 ‘ Intellegit ibi vitium vas efficere
ipsum Omniaque illius vitio corrumpier
intus‚'where the meaning is the same as
here, that till the heart is clean no plea-
sure can be enjoyed.

55 foll. Precepts towards the moral
health of which he has been speaking.

56. voto has been taken both as an
abl. closely with pete, ‘ aim your wishes
at a fixed point,’ and as a dative, ‘ find
a definite limit to your wishing'3 ep.
‘sit finis quaerendi⁷ Sat. 1. 1. 92.

58. Siculi tyranni, as Phalaris with
his brazen bull.

60. dolor, ‘ soreness.'

mens: what kind of ‘ feeling ’ is ex—
plained in the following line which
defines the occasions ‘in his hurry to
satisfy his vengesul hatred)

61. festinat : cp. Horace’s use of
‘ properare' with accus, Od. 3. 24. 02,
Epp. 1. 3. 28.

63. tu: see on Od. 1. 9. 16; and ep.
Epp. 1. 11. 22.

64 foll. ‘ It is possible if you begin in
time.’

64. tenera cervice : abl. with ‘ doci—
