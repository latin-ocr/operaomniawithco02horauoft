HORATII SATIRARUM

Dixerit insanum qui me totidem audiet atque
Respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergo.’

Stoice, post damnum sic vendas omnia pluris,

Qua me stultitia, quoniam non est genus unum,

Insanire putas?

Ego nam videor mihi sanus.

‘Quid, caput abscissum manibus cum portat Agave

Nati infelicis, sibi tum furiosa videturl'

Stultum me fateor, liceat concedere veris, 305
Atque etiam insanum; tantum hoc edissere, quo me

Aegrotare putes animi vitio?

‘ Accipe : primum

Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris ab imo

Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis, et idem

Corpore maiorem rides Turbonis in armis 310
Spiritum et incessum: qui ridiculus minus illo?

An quodcunque facit Maecenas te quoque verum est
Tantum dissimilem et tanto certare minorem?

298. totidem, neut. plur., a word for
every one of his.

299. ignoto, ‘ of which he knows so
little! The reference is to the fable of
the two wallets, ⁶ Peras imposuit Iuppiter
nobis duas; Propriis repletam vitiis post
tergum dedit: Alienis ante pectus sus-
pendit gravem,' Phaedr. 4. 10.

300. Stoice : Horace addressing
Damasippus, who has so amply proved
his acquaintance with the principles os
Stoicism‚ goes back to the sentence
pronounced on him in v. 32 ‘insanis
et tu,' and asks his critic to define the
form of madness which he imputes to
him.

sie: see on Od. 1. 3. 1; ‘as you answer
me this question.’

pluris : ‘at better profit ’ than you did
before your bankruptey. Horace sorgets
or ignores the fact that Damasippus has
given up the trade.

303, 304. The reply of Damasippus :
‘ Of course you do. The strongest
evidence does not convince mad people
that they are macl?

Agave, holding in her hands the head
of her son Pentheus, whom she has torn
to pieces in her Bacchic frenzy, is a pic-
ture from the Bacchae of Euripides, a
play which attracted Horace; see on
Od. 2. 19 passim.

303. manibus. The more picturesque
and sorcible reading of V, restored to
the text by Bentley as against ‘ demens?

Κρᾶτα δ’ ἄθλιον Ι ὅπερ λαβοῦσα τυγχάνει
μήτηρ χεροῖν Eur. Bacch. 1137.

305. veris, neut. as ‘ pravorum’ v.
244, ‘totidem' v. 2983 ‘let me give
in to truth.’

306. edissere. Virg. Aen. 2. 149
‘haec edissere vera roganti.'

308. aedificas: no doubt, on his
Sabine estate.

hoo est, longos imitaris. ‘This
means, you ape full-grown people‚
though you are a dwarf3' a figure, but
in playful allusion to the fact that he
was really ‘corporis exigui' Epp. 1.
20. 24. See Augustus⁷ jests on the
subject in his letters to the poet in the

extracts from the Suetonian lise of

Horace given in the Introd to vol. Ι.

309. moduli bipedalis. Suetonius
mentions a dwarf actually ‘bipedali
minor’ Aug. 43.

310. corpore maiorem, ‘too big
sor his body ’ : cp. ‘ onus corpore parvo
maius’ Epp. 1. 17. 40, ⁴ maiores pennas
nido ’ Epp. 1. 20. 21.

Turbonis, according to Scholiasts
a gladiator of small size but great
courage.

312. verum, ‘right,' above v. 2085
Epp.1.1. 11, 1. 7. 98, 1.12. 23.

te, sc. ‘ facere.¹

313. tantum, the reading of V;
most other MSS. having ‘tanto‚' an
accommodatiori to the ‘tanto’ which
follows. As Bentley shows, ‘tantof
