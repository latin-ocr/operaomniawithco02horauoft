 

LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 1.

223

Trita subest tunicae vel si toga dissidet impar,
Rides: quid mea cum pugnat sententia secum,
Quod petiit spernit, repetit quod nuper omisit,

ζ’ Aestuat et vitae disconvenit ordine toto, x
Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis?

100

Insanire putas sollemnia me neque rides,

Nec medici credis nec curatoris egere

A praetore dati, rerum tutela mearum

Cum sis et prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem

De te pendentis, te respicientis amici.

105

Ad summam: sapiens uno minor est Iove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum3
Praecipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est„ ’ -

subucula: acc. to Varro (fragm. pre-
served by Nonius& this was a second
tunic worn under the other.

pexae, of wool still fresh, with the
nap on. Cp. Mart. 2. 58. 1 ‘Pexatus
pulcre rides inea, Zoile, trita.'

96. dissidet. impar, corresponds to
‘toga defluit ' in Sat. 1. 3. 31.

99. aestuat, sways to and fro like
the tide.

disconvenit: Epp. 1. 14. 18.

ordine toto: his lise is a succession of
incongruities.

100. diruit, aedificat. Horace makes
the Stoic in Sat. 2. 3. 307 laugh at him
for spending money in building.

mutat quadrata: probably a pro-
verbial expression sor faneiful altera-
tions, based, as Lambinus suggested,
on the story told os Agesilaus (see
Plutarch, Ap. Laconica, Agesilai 27)
that on seeing in Asia square beams
used in the roof of a house he asked if
trees in that country were square, and
being told that they were round, said,
‘then if trees grew square would you
make your beams round ἶ) ’ Some modest
alterations in his Sabine villa would
be enough to give occasion to his own
ironical laughter at his own expense.

101. sollemnia, as the Schol. ex-
plains it, ‘ pro consuetudine eunctorum,’
one more madman in a mad world ; the
doctrine of Sat. 2. 3. For the use of
‘ sollemnis' cp. Epp. 1. 18. 49, 2. 1. 103;
sor the cogn. acc. with ⁴ insanire’ see
Sat. 2. 3. 63.

102. curatoris: see note on Sat. 2. 3.
217.

103. rerum tutela, etc, ‘though you
take such responsibility for me, and are
so sensitive for my reputation, and
though your lightest word has such
weight with mes

106. ad summam: cp. his way of
bringing a discussion to a close in Sat.
1. 3. 137 ‘Ne longum faciam.' He
sums up in this ironical way his whole
moral lecture. ‘ You see what Ι have
been saying. It is the old story. The
true object of desire is “wisdom,'’ the
“ wise man ’' is all that the Stoics have
called him—that Ι have often laughed
at them for calling him? See note on
Sat. 1. 3. 124 foll.

108. praecipue, ‘above all‚’ ‘as a
chief distinction!

sanUS, ‘ sound,' i.e. primarily‚ as opp.
to ‘insanus’ (v. 101), but the double
meaning suggests the playful qualifica-
tion, ‘ except when he has a bad cold.’
Orelli shows by quotations that among
the later Stoics at least the question was
common how far such minor physical
infirmities deduct from the perfect
happiness of the wise man. It is pos-
sible that there is a playful reference to
a medico—philosophical doctrine that
‘ pituita' (see on Sat. 2. 2. 75) clouded
the intellect. Cp. Plin. N. H. 20. 7. 26
‘ [lactucae] lentitiam pituitae digerunt
atque ut aliqui tradiderunt, sensus pur-
gant' with Pers. S. 2. 57 ‘Somnia
pituita . . . purgatissima '3 see Coning-
ton's note there. μ

Sat. 2. 2. 75.
