ΜΒ. 11. SAT. 7. 189

1 11—115. ⁶ Nay, you are a runaway, sor you are always trying to escape yourself
and give the slip to care; but you are caught again, as a slave might be.’

1 16-118. This last sally is supposed to exhaust Horace's patience, and after one
more thrust Davus is driven away by the threat that he shall be sent to the
Sabine farm.

It 15 a companion Satire to the third of this Book. The substantial part of both
15 111 the playsul use of a Stoic paradox as a text sor a discourse on the follies of
men. In both Horace turns the laugh against himself, Damasippus there, Davus
here, charging him with his own faults and especially with the two, laziness (Sat. 3?
and changeableness tSat. 7), 10 which he professes to plead guilty in Epp. Ι. 8. 10—
1 2. In the third Satire the thesis taken is the one dealt with in Ciceros Paradoxy 4
ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται, 111 this one Cicero's Paradox, 5 ὅτι μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος
καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος, There are signs in both that Horace was familiar with
Cicero's expositions of the text. The setting in each caseis dramatic, the para-
dox being pressed on Horace in Sat. 3 by the bankrupt virtuoso, who has himself
been saved from suicide by discovering that he was no more mad than most men
—in this Satire being put into the concrete form of a slave’s claim, urged with the
freedom os a licensed moment, to be as good as his master. In neither Satire is
the dramatic purpose kept perfectly; when the Stoic teaching is reached the style
becomes declamatory and imitative of the lccturer, and the particular occasion is
for the moment forgotten.

The Bland. MSS. had this Satire as have some good extant MSSs> written
continuously with the preceding one-evidently a mistake ; but it bears witness to a
true instinct of the close relation between this Satire and its predecessors. Bentley
explains ‘iamdudum ausculto' in v. Ι os Davus having heard Horace declaim Sat. 6,
and feeling stirred to answer it. This is probably put too narrowly ; but the position
of the Satire in relation to Sat. 6, when compared with that 'of Sat. 3 to Sat. 2, and
its position in relation to the Book in view of its manifest reference to both the
directly didactic Satires (cp. vv. 22, 23 with Sat. 2. 2. 89⁴9& as well as v. 28 with
Sat. 6) make it clear that one purpose is to lighten with his habitual irony any
tone of assumption that might be felt in the preceding Satires. ‘ who am Ι
to lecture others? They may very well return it in kinds

It should be noticed that it is irony, though the irony be a veil of real modesty.
Not to speak of the graver charges which he seems to countenance against himself,
his love sor the country which he appears here, for sear os having spoken too en—
thusiastically about it in Sat. 6, to undervalue as a mere phase of feeling, was deep
aud true; see Epp. 1. 10. 2 and 14. He contrasts his own constancy in respect of
it with his bailiff's changeableness, Epp. 1. 14. 14—26.
