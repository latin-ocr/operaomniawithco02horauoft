36 HORATII SATIRARUM

Usque ad mala citaret, ‘Io Bacche! ' modo summa

Voce, modo hac resonat quae chordis quattuor ima.

Nil aequale homini fuit illi; saepe velut qui

Currebat fugiens hostem, persaepe velut qui 10
Iunonis sacra ferret; habebat saepe ducentos,

the beginning to the end of the banquet.
It began with the ‘gustus,’ also called
‘promulsis‚' dishcs supposed to whet
the appetite, served sometimes imme-
diately on leaving the bath. Amongst
them are mentioned eggs: Mart. 12.
19. 1 ⁵ In thermis sumit lactucas, ova, la-
certum'; Plin. Epist. 1. 15 of a supper
prepared for himself and one friend,
‘ Paratae erant lactucae singulae, coch—
leae ternae, ova bina.' The apples are
part of the dessert, ‘mensae secundae.’
Mart. 10. 48. 18, at the end of the de-
scription of a supper, ‘saturis mitia
poma dabo? In the gastronomic lec-
ture of Sat. 2. 4, eggs are the first subject
treated, v. 11 ; apples come at the end,
v. 70.

7. citaret. Bentley pronounced the
verb impossible, and would substitute
‘ iteraret,' but it would seem that he had
missed the parallel ‘paeanem citare,’
which has since been quoted from Cic.
de Orat. 1. 59. 251. ‘Io Bacche’ in this
ease represents the accusative. ‘ Citare ‘
is probably the frequentative of ‘cieo'
in the sense of ‘ ciere vocem, murmur,
tinnitum,' etc. Prof. wilkins it is true
reads in that place ‘recitaret,’ but on
‘a priori' grounds; and is it certain
that ‘recitare paeanem’ would be a
suitable phrase? Cicero is speaking of
practising the voice in singing.

Io Bacche: the reading is doubtful,
the MSS. being divided between ‘ Bacche '
and ‘Bacchae' All the Bland. give
‘ Bacche‚' but the difference between ‘e ’
and ‘ ς’ and that in a proper name, is
one on which stress can hardly be
laid in MS. testimony. Hymns to
Bacchus were called from their first
words Ἰόβακχοι and Βακχέβακχοι (cp.
ἰηπαιωνίσαι καὶ βακχέβακχον ᾆσαι Arist.
Equ. 408). The lengthening of the
short ‘e‘ is justified by the metrical ietus;
cp. ‘ Hyla Hyla omne sonaret' Virg.
Eel. 6. 44. It is possible that the
effect of the voice dweiling on the note
is imitated. Of recent editors Haupt,
Ritter, Holder, and Munro give ‘io
Bacchae? No instance of such a cry is
quoted except from Eur. Bacchae, as

v. 596, where the Bacchants are person-
ages in the drama.

modo summa voce, i. e. now in a
low key, now in a high one: another
instance of his changeableness. ‘Summa’
= the Greek ὑπάτη, ‘ ima’ (‘ vox acuta’
Od. 3. 4. 3)=v⁷'7†⁷7‚ the terms used re-
spectively for what we should call the
lowest and the highest note of the tetra-
chord, the designations being apparently
given from the position of the strings of
an instrument as it was actually handled‚
not as with us from the parts of the
human throat employed in giving the
sounds.

8. chordis. It admits of doubt
whether this is a dative, ‘ voce ' then being
the note of the human voice, ‘ now on his
“ highest '’ note, now on that which
answers “ lowest '' to the tetrachord'3 or
an instrumental ablative ‘voce' being
the note absolutely, ‘the note which
sounds “lowest '² when you strike the
tetrachord.'

9. aequale, ‘uniform‚' ‘equable.’ Cp.
‘ inaequalis ' in describing a similar cha-
racter, Sat. 2. 7. 10.

saepe velut, qui. The constr. is
‘saepe currebat velut qui [curreret] fu—
giens hostem, persaepe [incedebat] ve-
lut qui Iunonis sacra ferret.' With the
ellipsis ofa verb to the first ‘ qui' cp.
Sat. 1. 1. 23. The verb which describes
a particular form ofmovement <‘currere ⁵)
having been transferred from its proper
place in the first relative clause to the
leading clause makes it necessary to un-
derstand a colourless verb or one which
describes another kind of movement
with the second leading clause. Cp. the
zeugma with ‘ crepat' in Od. 1. 18. 5, 6.

11. Iunonis sacra ferret. ‘Kaun-
φόροι apud Athenas hodieque dicuntur
quae sacra in capite portant et sensim
incedunt et lento gradu' Porph. Cp.
Sat. 2. 8. 13 ‘ut Attica virgo Cum sa-
cris Cereris procedit,' and Cic. de Off.
1. 36. 131 ‘Cavendum est ne tarditatibus
utamur in ingressu mollioribus ut pom-
parum ferculis similes esse videamur.’

habebat. Bentley read ‘ alebat‚’ fol-
lowing one MS. which gives ‘ halebat.'
