LIB. II.

Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.

Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,
Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,

Quam sapere et ringi.

Qui se credebat miros audire tragoedos,

In vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro;

Cetera qui vitae servaret munia recto

More, bonus sane vicinus, amabilis hospes,
Comis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis
Et signo laeso non insanire lagenae,

Posset qui rupem et puteum vitare patentem.

Hic ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus
Expulit elleboro morbum bilemque meraco,

Et redit ad sese:

Non servastis,' ait, ‘cui sic extorta voluptas

Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error.’

In this picture, drawn with a sympa-
thetie hand, of the poet who spares no
pains to make his poetry conform to the
rules of his art (‘ legitimum fecisse
poema ⁹), who chooses his language with
such nicety‚ whose verse is like a
strong clear stream, carrying fertility
where it flows, who wins by such labour
the appearance of ease, Horace is
drawing the ideal of the classical school
of Latin poetry, but his thoughts must
be specially of the master, probably just
lost, his friend Virgil.

125. Satyrum: cp. Od. 1. 1. 31
⁴ Nympharumque leves cum Satyris
chori,’ Virg. E. 5. 73 ‘ Saltantes Satyros
imitabitur.’

Cyclopa: cp. Sat. 1. 5. 63 ‘ Pasto—
rem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat.’ This
illustrates also movetur with the
accus.

126—148. No doubt if the choice were
open I should like to take my place
with the poets who admire themselves
on such easy terms. Any process of
disillusion is painful‚ as the man of
Argos found ; but (he goes on) the time
for such illusions is past.

Munro and Keller put a question at.
‘ ringi‚' which would slightly alter the
connection. ‘ Am 1 to prefer ’θ’ etc.

126. iners: cp. A. P. 446 ‘versus
inertes,' very possibly, as the Scholiasts

say, the word is used in both cases in its
etymological sense=‘arte carens (see
also on Epp. 1. 20. 12), but it may only
mean ‘spiritless‚' ‘dull': for such a
metaphorical use cp. Sat. 2. 2. 41 ‘car-
nem inertem‚’ of ‘ flavourless ' meat.
‘ Delirus' is ‘doting‚’ ‘silly.' Cp. its
uses in Sat. 2. 7. 107, 293, 2. 3. 71.

128. sapere et ringi: to be a phi-
losopher with his Cynic (snarling) tone
[instead of the poet with his genial
sels-complacency]. The words are here
metaphorical‚ only meant to describe
the pain of disillusion3 but the phrase
is taken up in v. 141.

131. qui servaret, ‘the sort of man
to keep‚' etc.

133. posset qui ignoscere servis:
these are marks of sanity. Cp. Sat. 1.
3. 80 f.‚ where ferocity towards slaves is
a sign of madness.

135. rupem, puteum : obvious dan-
gers; Sat. 2. 3. 55, A. P. 459.

137. elleboro: see on Sat. 2. 3. 82.
