LIB. II.

SAT. 6. 181

Postmodo quod mi obsit clare certumque locuto,
Luctandum in turba et facienda iniuria tardis.

‘Quid vis, insane, et quas res agis?' improbus urget

Iratis precibus; ‘tu pulses omne quod obstat, 30
Ad Maecenatem memori si mente recurras?’

Hoc iuvat et melli est3 non mentiar.

At simul atras

Ventum est Esquilias aliena negotia centum

Per caput et circa saliunt latus.

27. postmodo quod mi obsit, ‘to
my own harrn presently,' i. e. if my
friend, sor whom I have given security,
plays false. ‘Postmodo ' has been also
taken with 4 luctandum,⁷ ‘ p1·esently‚' i.e.
as I go home from court; but cp.
Od. 1. 28. 31 ‘nocituram postmodo te
natis.’

clare certumque. Palmer suggests
very probably that these words were
part of the formula in which the
‘sponsor⁷ was called upon to give his
pledge.

29. quid vis, insane. The words
of the ‘tardus' whom Horace has
elbowed. Most of the best MSS.
have ‘Quid tibi vis,’ which makes the
line unmetrical. Bentley pointed out
that this rather· than ‘quid vis' was
the usual phrase (cp. especially Propert.
Ι. 5. 3 ‘ Quid tibi vis, insane?' and
Pers. S. 5. 143‘ quo deinde, insane⁷ ruis?
quo? Quid tibi vis?'). He therefore
wished to accept it, and to emend the
verse by reading ‘quam rem ³ for ‘quas
res‚' quoting many instances of ‘ quam
rem agis' from the comic writers.
It is of course quite possible on the
other side that the fact that ‘quid tibi
vis ' was the commoner phrase led to the
early corruption. Several MSS„ read-
ing 4 quid tibi viss otherwise emend the
line, some omitting 4 agis‚' others omit-
ting ‘ et,' and putting ‘insane ⁷ aster 4 agis]

30. precibus, i.e. 4 imprecations.'
Epod. 5. 56; cp. Sat. 2. 3. 203 ‘mala
multa precati,' 2. 7. 36 ‘non reserenda
precati.'

tu pulses. Best taken as a further
remonstrance ofthe ‘ improbuS,' the ‘ un-
reasonable ' fellow who does not like to
be jostled by a man in a hurry. Horace
in his sels-consciousness imagines him to
know where he is going. Grammatically
it is a regular conditional sentence. ‘ Is
this the principle, the accepted condi-
tion, that if you, sir (“tu⁷')‚ are in a

‘ Ante secundam

hurry to get to Maecenas‘ house, where
you remember an engagement,you would
elbow any-thing or anybody that was in
your way? '

31. recurras. Schiitz well compares
‘revocant ⁷ in od. 4. 1. S, The 4 re-'
implies that Maecenas' house is his
habitual resort. With the whole pic-
ture of the man in a hurry, making his
way by jostling, cp. Plaut. Capt. 4. 2.
11 foll. 4 Eminor interminorque, ne quis
mihi obstiterit obviam, Nisi qui sat
diu vixisse sese horno arbitrabitur: Nam
qui obstiterit ore sistet,' etc.

32. hoe: these visits to Maecenas.
‘ They are, 1 will confess it, a sweetening
of town life; but I can't even pay thern
in peace. My very friendship with
Maecenas is a source of fresh worries.’

atras, from the old use of the place
before Maecenas built his palaee and
laid out the gardens; see Sat. Ι. 8, in-
trod. The epithet is complained of a<
out of keeping here3 but it seems pur-
posed, and to refer to what follows:
‘something of the old gloomy associa-
tions still hangs about it.'

34. per caput, ‘ over head and ears*
The nse of ‘per⁷ as in Catull. 17. 9
‘ per caput pcclesque.’

eirea latus, ‘in front and on flank.'
The metaphor of saliunt is doubtful:
of a hailstorm? of waves (Rideris) of
a swarm of troublesome inseets? It has
been questioned whether the lines that
follow describe requests which Horace
remembers (so Orelli, who takes 4 per
caput' as ‘through my head Ἴ, or which
are urged by messengers who waylay
him near Maecenas' door. A strong
argument for the latter view is the re-
petition of ‘ orabant‚’ which has a defi-
nite point if two independent messages
are reported, both harping on the same
troublesome string, but is un—Horatian
if he is speaking himself. If they
are in the mouth of messengers the
