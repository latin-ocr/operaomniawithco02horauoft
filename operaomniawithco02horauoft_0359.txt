Qui vel mense brevi vel toto est iunior anno.’

Utor permisso, caudaeque pilos ut equinae 45
Paulatim vello et demo unum, demo etiam unum,

Dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi

Qui redit in fastos et virtutem aestimat annis,

Miraturque nihil nisi quod Libitina sacravit.

Ennius et sapiens et fortis et alter Homerus, 50
Ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur

Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.

have honourable place‚’ place as ‘pro-
bus,' not (as Orelli and Ritter) ‘shall
be placed without discredit to the
placer.'

45. caudae pilos ut equinae. Has
Horace already begun the definite refe-
rence which appears in v. 47 to the
logical puzzle attributed by Diog. Laert.
(2. 108) to Eubulides, and called,
after two illustrations used os it, φαλα-
κρός or σωρίτης (transl. by Cic. Div. 2.
4. 11 ‘acervalis⁷; cp. the description
in Acad. Pr. 2. 16. 49 ‘captiosissimo
genere interrogationis utuntur, cum ali-
quid minutatim et gradatim additur vel
demitur. Sorites hoc vocant, quia acer-
vum efficiunt uno grano ’Π Those who
think so imagine that the horse's tail
was a recognized form of the illustration
called φαλακρός, the question of how
many hairs are the minimum that makes
a tail being substituted sor the question
how many hairs save a man from being
rightly called ‘bald’ The two forms
of the puzzle would however be then
rather awkwardly joined in one sen-
tence. It is better perhaps to suppose
that ‘like single hairs from a horse’s
tail‘ is a separate illustration of his
piecemeal destruction of his opponent's
argument. Lambinus suggested that
Horace had in mind the apologue (at-
tributed by Plutarch to Sertorius) os the
two men who tried to pluck out a horse's
tail, one by a single pull, the other hair
by hair.

46. etiam: the evidence for ‘ etiam'
and ‘ et item’ is nearly balanced. Bentl.
preferred ‘et item ’ (cp. Luer. 4. 543).
For ‘etiam' cp. Pers. S. 6. 58 ‘Adde
etiam unum: Unum etiam‚' which may
possibly be a reminiscence of this place.

47. eadat elusus. Orelli and others
say that the metaph. is of a gladiator
⁴ overthrown by a trick ' : but the words
are natural, and would not necessarily

bring any such definite image. In the
meantime they are given a new appro-
priateness by their relation to the words
that follow, as though the imagined
heap were represented as slipping away
by degrees from under the disputant
who rests upon it.

48. in fastos : to see the date before
pronouncing a judgment.

49. Libitina: Od. 3. 30. 7, Sat. 2.
6. 1 .

53-59. Illustrations of the rage for
the ancients, the illogical character of
which has been discussed. It is to be
remembered throughout that we are not
reading Horace's criticisms‚ but the
cant phrases and stock judgments which
are to be heard in the literary circles
which he is laughing at.

50. Ennius: Od. 4. 8. 20, Epp. 1.
19. 7. The epithets are from the cur-
rent language of the day. They rise
from a tone which Horace would echo
to an hyperbole (‘a second Homer ⁹)
which he would condemn.

51. leviter curare videtur. These
words are rightly interpreted by Porph.,
as Bentley shows, ‘ securus iam de pro-
ventu laudis suae est Ennius propter
quam ante sollicitus fuerat'; ‘he has
attained now such assured fame (as one
of the ‘ancients‚' Horace speaks with
some irony) that he can afford to let
his own professions and dreams of
metempsychosis take their chance of
being true or Ποῖ] Ennius, so Porph.
further explains, in the beginning os the
Annals had described a dream of his
own in which he was assured that the
soul of Homer had reappeared in his
person: see note on Pers. S. 6. 10,
Ennius, Annal. 15 (Vahlen).

52. Pythagorea. For Horace’s tone
towards Pythagorean tenets see introd.
to Od. 1. 283 and cp. Epod. 15. 21,
Sat. 2. 6. 63.
