HORATII EPISTULARUM

Esto aliis alios rebus studiisque teneri:
Idem eadem possunt horam durare probantes?

know not how,' after Od. 1. 12. 45
‘crescit occulto velut arbor aevo.' In
the latter case the epithet would suggest
the idea of an ‘ unearned increment‚⁷ and
so ofan invidious mode ofmoney-making.

84. lacus et mare: the Lucrine lake
and the sea outside the bar. The rich
proprietor disturbs both by his building.
Cp. on the subject Od. 2. 18. 19—22,
3. 1. 33—40, 3. 24. 1—4.

sentit, in a bad sense, ‘ seels the effects
of‚’ ‘ smarts for.'

85. libido, ⁴ fancy,’ ‘ caprice.'

86. fecerit auspicium: ‘facere au-
spicium’ is said of the birds or other
appearances that give the omen.

Teanum, i. e. from the seaside to an
inland town. Teanum called ‘Sidicinum‚'
to distinguish it from the town os the
same name in Apulia, was a town os
Campania on the Via Latina between
Cales and Casinum.

87. lectus genialis τ the bed dedicated
to the genius (called ‘lectus adversus'
Prop. 4. 11. 85) which stood in the
‘ atrium ' of a house where a married
couple lived.

est : see above on vv. 33, 58.

89. bene esse: Od. 2. 16. 43.

90. Protea: see on Sat. 2. 3. 71.

91. quid pauper? A reply of the
rich man to Horaee's arraignment.
Perhaps, as Cruquius suggests, it is
meant to be the answer of Maecenas
himself. Horace hastens to answer
that the same charge of inconstancy

,bu-11 f

holds against all, against himself. It is
the commencement of the ironical con-
clusion. For the meaning of ‘ pauper '
see on Od. 1. 1. 18. It covers, as we
see, a man in Horace's own station.

cenacula: by usage, of the hired
garrets os the poor. See Mayor on Juv.
S. 10. 18.

92. conducto navigio: though he
has to hire the boat, he goes to sea and
is sick just as much as the rich man who
has his own trireme.

93. priva triremis: see on Od. 2. 16.
21-24 and 3. 1. 37 foll.

94. inaequali tonsore, an abl. absol.
<see on Od. 1. 6. Ι). The point is not a
general air of untidiness but the par-
ticular incongruities—the hair trimmed
unevenly on the two sides, a new outer
tunic and an old inner one, a ‘toga’
that sits unequally on the two shoulders.
Maecenas' eye is especially quick sor the
want of harmony in any such external
matters yet he is blind to greater interna]
inconsistencies. At the same time the
passage would seem to imply that
Horace actually laid himself open to
such criticisms, and therefore increases
the probability that in Sat. 1. 3. 31 foll.
he is thinking of himself.

95. occurri. The omission os the
pronoun or any emphatic marl< of a
change of subject or person addressed
supports Cruquius' view, that the refer-
ence to Horace himself has begun in
the preceding lines.
