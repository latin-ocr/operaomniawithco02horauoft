HORATII ARS POETICA.

Et faciunt prope plura dolentibus ex animo, sic

Derisor vero plus laudatore movetur.

Reges dicuntur multis urgere culullis

Et torquere mero quem perspexisse laborant, 435
An sit amicitia dignus: si carmina condes

Nunquam te fallant animi sub volpe latentes.

Quintilio si quid recitares, ‘Corrige sodes

Hoc,' aiebat, ‘et hoc:' melius te posse negares

Bis terque expertum frustra, delere iubebat 440
Et male tornatos incudi reddere versus.

Si defendere delictum quarn vertere malles,

433. derisor: used in Sat. 2. 6. 54 of
one who laughs in his sleeve while he
says what he does not mean.

434-437. ‘ They tell us kings want to
see a man drunk (“ in vino veritas⁷') as
well as sober before they feel sure that
he is well affected.’ It would seem as
though Horace was going to make the
analogy complete by saying ‘ you have
only tried your panegyrist when he is
drunk, full of your good dinners and
generosity ψ’ inter lances mensasque
nitentes Cum stupet insanis acies fulgori-
bus '' Sat. 2. 2. 4): can you try him,
like them, under the opposite condi—
tions?’ But the exact parallelism, if it
was in his mind, is dropped, and he con-
cludes with an Aesopean turn, ‘if you
write verses and some one praises you,
look to your fox's motive.’

435. torquere mero: Epp. Ι. 8. 38
‘ vino tortus! See on Od. 3. 21. 13.

perspexisse :
3. 4. 51.

436. condes: Epp. 1. 3. 24.

437. animi sub volpe latentes.
‘ Sub volpe ' is under a cunning exterior.
If there is reference to a particular fable
the Comm. Cruq. is no doubt right in
suggesting the Fox and the Crow
(Phaedr. 1. 13), for it was the praise of
the Crow’s looks and the prospective
praise of his voice that made him drop
the eheese‚ but the suggestion of a fable
which is not distinctly realized is in
Horace's way.

fallant: the reading of B, supported
by Ach ; ‘they will not, Ι am sure, take
you in.

438. Quintilio: see on Od. 1. 24.

faithful critic, the characteristics at-
tributed to him in the odes, ⁴ incorrupta
fides nudaque veritas?

si recitares . . . aiebat. Cp. Epp.
1. 16. 46 ‘si dicat . . . aio‚' and see on
Sat, 1. 3. 5 ‘si peteret! There is no
sense of impossibility or denied con-
dition z it is ‘si recites,' ⁵ supposing you
read‚' thrown into past time: the apo-
dosis is put unconditionally.

sodes: Sat. 1. 9. 41; Epp. 1. 1. 62,
1. 7. 15, 1. 16. 31.

439. negares, i. e. ‘ si negares.'

440. bis terque: see above on v.
358, Epod- 5· 33- ,

441. male tornatos. Emended in-
geniously‚ but unacceptably‚ by Bentl. to
‘ter natos’ ; ‘after three unsuccessful
births.’ He allows that either the lathe
or the anvil by itself is an habitual figure
for the productiori of poetry: the first of
its neat finish (from Aristophanes' τὰ δὲ
τορνεύσει Thesm. 54 to Propertius’ ‘ au-
gusto versus includere tomo’ 2. 25. 43) ;
the second of the rougher process of
original composition; see Ov. Trist. 1.
7. 29 ‘ Ablatum mediis opus est incudi-
bus illud, Defuit et scriptis ultima lima
meis.’ Fea, who has treated this point
most elaborately, shows that there is no
inherent difficulty, as Bentley thought,
in the combination of the two. He
proves that metal work was turned.
Horace will then say, ‘ if the turning has
been done badly, send the piece of metal
back to the fire and hammer, and re—
commenee the process’ F ea quotes
from Symmachus (4th cent.) Epp. 1. 4,
a complete parallel, ‘illa [epigrammata]
bono metallo cusa torno exigi nesci-
erunt.’

442. vertere, ‘ to alter.'
