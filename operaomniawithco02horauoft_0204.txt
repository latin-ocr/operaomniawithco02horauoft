HORATII SATIRARUM

Romae rus optas, absentem rusticus urbem

Tollis ad astra levis.

Si nusquam es forte vocatus

Ad cenam laudas securum olus ac, velut usquam 30
Vinctus eaS, ita te felicem dicis amasque

Quod nusquam tibi sit potandum.

Iusserit ad se

Maecenas serum sub lumina prima venire

Convivam: “Nemon oleum feret ocius? Ecquis

Audit?'’ cum magno blateras clamore fugisque. 35
Mulvius et scurrae tibi non referenda precati

Discedunt.

“Etenim fateor me‚'' dixerit ille,

“Duci ventre levem, nasum nidore supinos,
Imbecillus, iners, si quid vis adde popino.

Tu, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior, ultro

40

Insectere velut melior verbisque decoris

28. In this and the following verses
there is of course primarily reference to
Sat. 2. 6. 60 foll. For the charge of
inconstancy in his preference of town
and country, cp. Epp. 1. S. 12.

absentem, of the place from which
one is absent; cp. Epp. 1. ΙΙ. 21.

30. velut usquam vinctus eas, ita.
¹ Ita ⁷ is to be taken before ‘ velut ’ς ‘just
as though you went anywhere in chains,’
i. e. on compulsion. For ‘ usquam eas '
see on Sat. 1. 1. 37 and cp. Epp. 1. 7.
25.

31. amasque, ‘hug yourself,' i. e. are
pleased with yourself. The comm. quote
Cic. ad Att. 4. 16 ‘in eo me valde
amo.>

33. serum convivam. Evidently, of
a guest invited late, to fill up a vacancy.

sub lumina prima, about the light-
ing of the lamps; Epp. 2. 2. 98.

34. oleum. Doubtless for the lamp
to light him through the dark streets.
On this see Juv. S. 3. 285 foll., with
Mayor's note. The Scholiast took it
of the anointing at the time of the bath,
‘ut lotus et unctus abeat cenatum ’; but
this would imply an earlier hour and
more leisurely start.

feret. Holder gave ⁶ fert ⁹ in his text
(1869), but Keller has returned in his
Epilegomena to ‘feret‚’ the reading of
the Bland. Mss.

35. fugis, ι you are off.’ The reading
is doubtful. V had ‘suris.' Acr. in-
terprets ‘fugis' ‘expressit velocitatem
hominis festinantis ad cenam.⁷ Holder

points out that ‘ furit ' is a corruption of
‘fugit' in Epp. 2. 2. 75. Prof. Palmer
quotes for ‘ fugis,' Plaut. Asin. 2. 2. 113
‘ quasi tunm officium facis ergo ac fugis? '
Poen. Ι. 3. 17 ⁴ Mi, propera atque abi.
Ag. fugio. Ali. meum est istuc magis
officinm quam tuum'; where there is
allusion to the ‘ fuga ⁹ of slaves. In the
same way he thinks there is irony in
putting the word into Davus’ mouth os
his master.

36. Mulvius. An unknown name.
et adds the genus, ‘ Mulvius and
(other) parasites.⁷ See on Sat. 2. 4. 28.
These professional diuers-out have come
to share Horace’s meal and they have
to go away supperless.

precati=‘impreeati’; Sat. 2. 3. 203,
2. 6. 30.

non referenda, ‘ not meant to be re-
peated to you.’

37. dixerit ille, sc. ‘ Mulvius? Davus
imagines what the lesser parasite may
have said of the gTeater; the only differ-
ence is that Mulvius avows his motives
more honestly than Horace.

38. supinor. For the quasi-middle
use Schijtz compares ‘ purgor bilem' A.
P. 302. The verb describes the opening
of the nostrii and laying back of the
head in snuffing up the savoury smell.

40. tu, ‘ you, sir? Cp. with the pro-
noun and the whole constr. Sat. 2. 6.
30.

41. insectere, i. e. in the satires
which assail gluttony and laugh at
parasites.
