To THE sATIREs. 7

qualifies it‚—‘ Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro? On the other hand
in Epp. 2. 1. 250 ‘ sermones . . . repentes per humum’ seems meant
to cover the Epistles as well ¹.

The term had in the first place a sels-depreciatory meaning, and is
explained by the words in Sat. Ι. 4. 39-48, where he declines the
name of ‘ poemata’ for his writings, and designates them as ‘sermoni
propiora‚’ comparing them in this respect to Comedy, which is, ‘nisi
quod pede certo Differt sermoni, sermo merus.⁷ They were poeihs,
if poems at all, on the level of common conversation. But it was
a deliberate substitution not only for ‘poemata,’ but also for the
natural name, which he had at first given, of ‘ Satirae.' It was meant
to describe the poems as Horace wished them to be regarded, and if
‘sermo' be taken in its common sense of ‘talk' it describes them
very well ². Whatever else they are, they are imitations of conversa-
tion—‘talks‚' ‘causerz'es'-—imitations of the best talk of a polished
time—in its ease, its diversity of topic, its graceful transi-tions, its
spice of personality‚ its play of repartee, its irony, its anecdotes, sableS,
quotations, allusions ³. But the talk had a definite scope. It was
such talk as Horace indicates in Sat. 2. 6. 71 f., on subjects of the
highest interest, even if treated with a light hand. It was talk cm tlze
artos living. Even literature has an incidental rather than a primary
place in it. He has to make his ‘apologia’ both for venturing to
follow Lucilius and for venturing to differ from him 3 and this raises the
question, which will occupy so much of his later writingS, of the taste
of the day in its unqualified preference of the older writers to the new
classical school to which he attaches himself. He is also at first the
conscious ‘freedman’s son,' the mark of envious tongues, and he has
to justify his right to ‘ open his mouth ' as though his ancestors as well

¹ The Scholiast's statement is ‘ Quam—
vis Satiram esse opus hoc suum Hora-
tius ipse confiteatur, “sunt quibus in
Satira videar nimis acer,” tamen proprios
titulos ei voluit accommodasse ; nam hos
priores duos libros Semnonum poste-
riores Epz'stularum inscripsit.' Porph.
on Sat. 1. 1. 1. This speaks of Horace’s
ultimate distinction of titles for the
Satires and Epistles, and is not incon-
sistent with his coupling the two to-
gether under the common title while
the Epistles were still in process of
composition. Keller's MSS. know of
no title sor the Satires but ‘Sermones,'
and· it is the term used by the gram-
manans.

² It is just possible that the term
drew a further colour from its use of

philosophical conversations (cp. ‘ Socra-
tici sermones' Od. 3. 21. 9) and especi-
ally by Cicero of his Dialogues. Dia-
logue plays a large part in all Horace's
Satires, and in Book ΙΙ we have almost
entirely dramatic scenes in which
Horace himself plays no part or a sub·
sidiary one.

³ A characteristic feature of conversa·
tion is markedly imitated in the ending>-
of the Satires, and of the Epistles which
approach most nearly to this type.
They end generally abruptly; but just
as talk is ended, when the topic threatens
to become wearisome, with a jest or
persona] sally, or again with an epi-
gram, fable, or story, which sums up
the matter and leaves no more to be

said.
