HORATII EPISTULARUM

Si noles sanUS‚ curres hydropicus; et ni
Posces ante diem librum curn lumine, si non 35
Intendes animum studiis et rebus honestis,

Invidia vel amore vigil torquebere.

Nam cur

Quae laedunt oculos festinas demere, si quid
Est animum, differs curandi tempus in annum? a
Dimidium facti qui coepit habet3 sapere aude; 40

Incipe.

Qui recte vivendi prorogat horam

Rusticus exspectat dum defluat amnis; at ille

Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum.

Quaeritur argentum puerisque beata creandis ·-

Uxor, et incultae pacantur vomere silvae: 45
Quod satis est cui contingit nihil amplius optet.

34. et couples two statements, the
one of which is the illustration and
analogue of the other. ‘As if you will
not take exereise while you are well you
will have to do so to cure an illness3 sois
you will not wake to study and honour-
able effort, you will wake to suffer the
torture of bad passions.’ For the use
of ‘et’ cp. ‘ neque, nec ’ Od. 3. 5. 27 n.
Some good MSS. have ‘nolis' and
‘ cures,’ and Bentley prefers this reading,
understanding ‘expergisci‚’ but the
Bland. had ‘ curres,' and the Scholiasts
interpret it.

39. est: sc. ‘edit’

in annum: Epp. 1. 11. 23; ‘till
next year‚’ i. e. indefinitely.

40. dimidium, etc. A Greek pro-
verb, ἀρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ παντός.

41. recte vivendi: Epp. 1. 6. 29,
1. 8. 4‚1.16. 17, 2. 2. 213.

42. rusticus exspectat ‘is as the
countryman waiting sor the river to
run by,’ i. e. acts as though he thought
time would stop for him. One of
Horace’s fables remembered or invented.
It is not found elsewhere.

43. volubilis: Od. 4. 1. 40. Notice
the imitative rhythm os the verse de—
scribing the unbroken course of the
sliding water.

44 foll. Excuses imagined sor him
who postpones his sels-reformation. He
is busy for the moment getting money,
or a wife, or bringing an estate into
order. (Cp. the excuses in the Parable
of the Guestsss Horace allows them,
but gives cautious. Such desires must

be limited to what is enough. They
must not be allowed to degenerate into
unsatisfied cravings. Moral health is
necessary to any enjoyment.

44. beata. Perhaps best taken as by
the Scholiasts (‘partn felix ⁷), and as
by Ritter, closely with ‘ pueris creandis.'
The two lines seem meant to describe
a man's aims from his own point of
view, and the irony (which Orelli and
others imagine) of the juxtaposition,
³ a rich wife to bear children‚⁷ would be
out of place.

45. pacantur, ‘are in process of
being tamed.' Other things must wait
till the urgent task is accomplished.
The metaphor implies both the bene-
ficence of the work and the struggle in-
volved. It is better taken, with Orelli
and earlier editors, of forest land re-
claimed‚ a metaphor frorn the civilizing
progress of Roman arms (cp. ‘mitiget’
Epp. 2. 2. 186), than with Ritter and
Dillr (after Lachmann on Lucret. 5.
1203) in the more litera] sense. of clear-
ing the country of wild beasts (as Manil.
4. 182 ‘ pacare metu silvas '). The in-
terpretation is given by ‘ incultae' on the
one side and ‘vomere' on the other.
Cp. the picture of the breaking up os
woodland in Virg. G. 2. 207-211.
Orelli's quotation of id. v. 239 ‘ea
[terra] nec mansuescit arando ' is tempt-
ing, but not fully in point, sor there. as
in Lucret. 5. 1368, which Virgil had in
mind, the ideas put together are of
taming wild animals and exchanging
wild growths for cultivated.
