Numicius they become in v. 68 ‘his’ in
relation to himself and Numicius to-
gether. ‘ Istis' is to be referred, not to
the advice of Mimnermus (as Pope per-

Epistle), but to the whole tenor of the

EPISTLE VII.

TO MAECENAS.

Verses 1—9. I TALKED osa few days in the country, Maecenas, and it has proved
to mean all August. But as you would excuse me if Ι were ill, so you must
excuse me for shunning what makes me ill.

10-13. Rome in autumn is deadly3 and if the winter is cold, 1 must go to the
sea-coast ; so you must not look for me till the spring.

14—19. Your generosity to me has not been that of the Calabrian host who presses
on his guest pears that are so plentisul that what he refuses goes to the pigs.

20-24. True generosity chooses worthy objects‚ but gives what it values. I hope
Ι 3111 not unworthy of your bounty.

25—28. What fails me is youthful health and vigour‚ and that you cannot restore
to me.

29-34. If any 0116 says ‘you have surrendered your liberty, and ean only regain
it in the same way as the vixen who got into the corn-bin when she had 311
empty stomach‚’ I take him at his word.

35, 36. Ι quite mean what I say, and really prefer liberty to wealth.

37—43. It is not that Ι 3111 disconteuted or ungrateful3 but you would see that
I could cheersully return all you gave me, and answer as Telemachus
answered when horses which he could never use were offered to him.

44, 45. What I want now is not the grandem· of Rome but the leisure and peace
of the country.

46-98. The story of Philippus and Volteius is a warning to the givers and receivers
of patronage. The latter should be wise in time and draw back 35 50011 as
they find that the offered improvement of their position is no improve-
ment. The measure which suits one man will not suit another.

The Epistle is a picture of patronage as z‘t should be and as it should not he.
It is implied in the idea of such 3 poem as well as asserted in words in it, that
Maecenas' patronage has been of the former kind‚—such as was honourable both to
patron and to poet. The Epistle, therefore, ranges itself with Sat. 1. 5, 6, and
9, which describe and defend Horace's relation to Maecenas.
