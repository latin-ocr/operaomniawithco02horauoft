C. Trebatius Testa was a ‘ iurisconsultus’ of repute, a friend and correspondent
of Cicero, who introduced him to Julius Caesar (Cic. ad Fam. 7. 5). The letters
(ad Fam. 7. 6-22) are addressed to him, and the Topica is dedicated to him <Top.
1. Ι). Cicero's letters to him are familiar, and deal in raillery‚ as in ad Fam. 7. 10,
where he rallies him for shrinking from crossing the British channel, though he
was a votary of swimming, and in 22, where writing to justify a legal reference
which he had made the night before, and which Trebatius had treated contempt-
uously‚ he says ‘illuseras heri inter scyphos,’ and says that though they had drunk
deep he had been himself sober enough on his return home to turn out the passage
which he sends. It is supposed that Horace has such traits in view in vv. 8, 9.
Trebatius is probably dead at the time, and Horace's interest in him is a literary
one through Cicero's letters.

gests, there are several points in the
similitude, one or other of which may
be prominent. It may be a compli-
ment, as expressing the fineness of the
work, or a depreciative expression, as
here, of its length and thinness.

5. praescribe. If not actually a
technical term in this sense, it is a word
sor authoritative advice generally, and
also a word which, with its cognates
‘ praescriptum‚’ ‘ praescriptio ’ had tech-
nical associations.

1. Sunt quibus videar. The ba-
lance is in favour of ‘videar’ against
‘ videor‚' especially as Porph. so quotes
it on Sat. 1. Ι. 1.
See on Od. 1. 1. 3.

ultra legem . . ,opus Comparing
A. P. 135 ‘operis 1ex,’ ‘legem' is
perhaps best taken as meaning in the
first place, ‘ its own proper limits '—‘ to
make Satire more trenchant and per-
sonal than it should be.' But there is
probably something of the play with
which the Satire ends, where ⁴ mala ' is

taken by one speaker in a lz'terary‚ by
the other in a legal, sense.

2. tendere, ‘to strain.' The meta-
phor of a bowstring may bein the back-
ground, but it is not clearly felt; still
less is the metaphor kept up (as Dillr.
says) in ‘sine nervis,’ which means
‘ without sinews‚’ ‘ flaccid,' as A. P. 26
‘sectantem levia nervi deficiunt.’ Cp.
Cicero’s use of ‘enervatus' and ‘ner-
vosus ’ of style.

altera pars, ‘the other half of the
world.'

4. deduci, the metaphor from spin-
ning, as in Epp. 2. 1. 225 ‘ tenui deducta
poemata fi10‚⁷ Virg. Ecl. 6. 5 ‘ deduc-
tum carmen,' etc. As Conington sug-

tentious style of the man of wisdom.

ne faciam: not after ‘ inquis,’ which
is parenthetical and intended to express
surprise, ‘Do you say'? ‘ Can I hear
right’? but adapted to the construction
of the preceding ⁴ quiescas‚’ of which it
is offered as an interpretation, as that is
adapted to the construction of Horaee's
request, the first ‘ praescribe’ suggesting
‘ praescribo ' and ‘ praescribis ' in the
clauses that follow. ‘ Ne faciam ³ gives
a certain play by its likeness to ‘quid
saciam‚’ as though Horace said⁷ ‘I asked
you what to do and you tell me what
not to do.’
