 

LIB. I.

SAT. 4. 51

At tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras,
Usque laborantes dum ferrum molliat ignis, 20

Ut mavis imitare.

Beatus Fannius ultro

Delatis capsis et imagine; cum mea nemo
Scripta legat vulgo recitare timentis ob hanc rem,
Quod sunt quos genus hoc minime iuvat, utpote plures

Cul pari dignos.

Quemvis media elige turba: 25

Aut ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat.
Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hic puerorum,
Hunc capit argenti splendor3 stupet Albius aere ;

19. The similitude expresses both
windiness and length. The metaph. is
imitated by Pers. Sat. 5. 10 and Juv. S.

‘ quicquid scripsere beati ‚' of the happi-
ness of sels-satisfaction.

Fannius: ‘ineptus Fannius Hermo—
genis . . conviva Tigelli ’ Sat. 1. 10. 80.
He is not mentioned otherwise in extant
Roman literature. The Scholiasts call
him ‘Quadratus,’ which was a cognomen
in the gens Fannia. Aer. says he wrote
Satire, which is against the point of this
passage, for Horace is saying that he is
himself less popular than Fannius because
he writes Satire. The meaning ofthe fol-
lowing words can only be guessed. The
Schol. offer us several guesses, some
evidently wrong, as that the senate
presented Fannius with his bust and
some book-cases3 or that his heirs sent
his bust and book-cases to some public
library3——but Fannius surely was alive
in Sat. 1. 10. ultro should mean that
the act, whatever it was, was one of his
own sels-sufficiency. When Pollio
founded out of the spoils of his Illy rian
campaign the first public library in
Rome, he put into it‘ imagines' of the
great authors, but admitted Varro alone
of living writers (Plin. N. H. 7. 31).
Pollio's campaign and triumph were in
B. c.‘39. It is possible therefore that the
reference is to some story of Fannius
having volunteered for the same honour.
Or it may mean that he presented his
bust and books to private libraries. For
‘imagines ’ in private libraries see
Mayor on Juv. S. 7. 29.

22. capsis : cases put to the same use
as ‘ serinia ' (see on Sat. 1. 1. 120), but
apparently the smaller. Sat. 1. 10. 63,
Epp. 2. 1. 268.

mea . . timentis. Madv. ξ 297 a.

Cp. vv. 71—74. They are not published

and are not read to mixed audiences.

24. genus hoe, sc. Satire.

Greek than Latin, os the causal clause

sint ’ into apposition to the pronoun
‘sunt quos.’ These ‘ some' are, or be-
long to, the majority who know that
they deserve the satirist‘s lash.

2 5. elige. The text is doubtful. ‘Three
Bland’ had ‘eripe‚‘ ‘one' (the special
reading of V. is not given) ‘ eliges
Some good MSS. have ‘ erue.’ Acron’s
schol. ‘de medio populo producito ’
gives no clear indication.

26. ob avaritiam. ‘Laborare ob '
is a constr. not found elsewhere. Bentley
would therefore read ‘ ab avaritia‚' which
has since been found in a single MS.
There is some MS. authority for another
change, ¹ miser ' sor ‘ misera‚’ i. 6. ‘ miser
ob avaritiam aut ambitione.' ‘ Labo—
rare’ is used absolutely, so that there is
no inherent impropriety in the constr.

‘laborare ob avaritiam.' Any harshness
is softened by the distance and the inter-
vention osa second construction. Orelli
and Dinr. quote to show that the varia-
tion between ⁴ ob ' with accusative, and
an ablative in the same sentence is
common though in the cases which they
quote some difference of relation can be
detected in the two clauses.
