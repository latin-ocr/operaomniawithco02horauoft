HORATII SATIRARUM

Primores populi arripuit populumque tributim,

Scilicet uni aequus virtuti atque eius amicis. 70
Quin ubi se a volgo et scena in secreta remorant

Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,

Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere donec

Decoqueretur olus soliti.

Quicquid sum ego, quamvis

Infra Lucili censum ingeniumque, tamen me 75
Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque

Invidia, et fragili quaerens illidere dentem

Offendet solido; nisi quid tu, docte Trebati,

Dissentis.

‘Equidem nihil hinc diffindere possum

Sed tamen ut monitus caveas, ne forte negoti 80

69. arripuit, ‘laid hands on,' Sat 2.
3,. 224; perh. with the Ciceronian asso-
ciation of ‘arresting,' ‘ in ius vocandis

tributim: cp. Cicero's ‘ dare specta-
cula tributi1n‚⁷ Mur. 34. 72. It balances
‘ primores :' he struck high and low, and
he struck far and wide.

70. Orelli conjectures, not improbably,
that the expressions of this verse (in-
cluding the use of ‘eius'> may be Lu-
cilius' own.

71. ‘Yet not only were Scipio and
Laelius not offended or frightened, they
made a companion and playmate of
Lucilius!

a. volgo et> scena, the throng and
show of public life.

72. virtus Scipiadae: see Od. 1.
3. 36 n., 3.21. 12.

sapientia: the name of ‘sapiens'
was specially given to him according
to Plutarch (Vit. Tib. Gracchi 8) on
account of his political moderation or
pliability. Cicero (de Am. 2) gives it
a wider reference.

73. discincti, ‘in easy undress,’ liter-
ally and metaphorically; see on Epod.
1. 34. The Comm. Cruq. gives a pic-
ture of Lucilius pursuing Scipio and
Laelius round the couches osa triclinium
with a twisted napkin ‘ quasi feriturus ;’
an illustration or a fictitious expansion
of the words in which Cicero describes
the friends in the country ⁴ incredibiliter
repuerascere esse solitos . . . et ad om-
nem animi remissionem ludumque de—
scendere' de Or. 2. 6. 10, 11.

74. olus, of their simple sare, Sat.
2. 7. 30; Ep. 1. 5. 2, 1. 17.3; cp. Sat.
1. 1. 74.

soliti, sc. ‘ sunt' as above, v. 67.

75. censum, as much below Lucilius
in social rank as in wit. Lucilius was
a Roman knight, of a good family; his
sister was grandmother to Pompey.

76. cum magnis: cp. Epp. 1. 20. 25.

77. fragili . . . solido, neuters. There
is the hint ofa sable, as of the viper and
the file.

78. Horace sostens the sels-assertion
of the last lines, by this submission of
his sentiments to the judgment of Tre-
batius.

79. diffindere, a very doubtful read-
ing. Of the Schohasts, Porph. ex-
pressly recognises the vv. ll. ‘ diffingere,'
and ‘diffidere’ Acr. gives an inter-
pretation of both ‘ diffingere ' and ‘ dif-
findere.’ V. had ‘ diffindere‚⁷ the other
Bland. MSS. ‘ diffingere.⁷ Our existing
authorities are divided between these
words and ‘diffide1·e‚' ‘ diffundere? If
we retain ‘diffindere' we must accept
Acron’s reference to the formula of the
Praetor, apparently in adjourning a trial
‘ hic dies diffissus esto’ : cp. Liv. 9. 38
‘triste omen diem diffidit.’ Trebatius
then would say ‘ there is nothing in what
you say that needs further thought‚’ i. e.
‘ I assent at once’ ; but there is no proof
that ‘ diffindere rem' was equally good
with ‘diffindere diem'; and though a
legal phrase seems wanted, this is not
quite the sense we expect. Bentley
argues for the alternative ‘diffingere’
(accepted by Munro, and by Keller in
his Epikgomena, though K. and H. give
‘ diffindere ²) which he interprets, as Acr.
‘mutare‚ infirmare,’ in the same sense
as in Od. 1. 35. 39, 3. 29. 47, ‘to alter.’

80. ut monitus caveas, for constr.
see on Od. 4. 9. 1.
