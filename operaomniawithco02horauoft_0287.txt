LIB. I. EPIST. 13. 273

EPISTLE XIII.

To VINIUS ASINA.

THIS professes to be a letter addressed to one Vinius Asina who is convcying
some 11001115 01 Horace to the Emperor : the letter is supposed 10 be 50111 aster the
messenger to reiterate instructions already given as to the care and 1301 10 be
observed in discharging his commission.

It seems obvious that it is an ‘ Epistle⁷ 111 form only ι being analogous 111 this
respect 10 Epp. 1. 20, 101 11 15 intended primm-ily sor Augustus, to whom it offers 3
jesting apology 101 any untimeliness in thr· poct's presentation of his poems. 11 15
3 dramatic rendering of the cantion in approaching Caesar which he recognizes as
necessary in sat. 2. 1. 1840, and 01 1110 apolog-etio tone with which he addresses
the Emperor (1110011)γ 111 Ε1111. 2. 1. 1—4. Much of the point and of the imagery 01
1110 Epistle lies in the play on the family name of the mcssenger, 3 play 111 which
the Romans delightcd, and which seems not 10 113νο been necessarily ossensive to
those who bore the name.

For further questions as to 110150113111)1 01 Vinius, the nature of the ζ carmina ’ of
v. 17, and of the circumstances imagined, see the additional note 31 the end 01 the
Epistle.

The Epistle should be compared with the poem (5. 6) in which Marti-al begs
Parthenius to introduce his book unobtrusively 10 Domitian's notice.

1—5. ‘ Let me repeat the orders I gave you on starting. Yon are to give Augustus
my poems at the right moment, 1101 11010 him with 1110111.

6—9. Refuse the commission at once rather than discharge it so as 10 recall your
family name of Asina.

10—15. An ass’s strength by all means in overcoming the difficulties of the errand ;
11111 01100 arrived you have still to wateh your opportunity for presenting the
book, and for that you want grace and 1301.

16-19. Don⁷t tell any one your errand. Now away with you, and have a care 01
stumbling.’
