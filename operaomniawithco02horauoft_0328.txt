HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ac, ne te retrahas et inexcusabilis absis,

Quamvis nil extra numerum fecisse modumque

Curas, interdum nugaris rure paterno3 60
Partitur lintres exe1·citus; Actia pugna

Te duce per pueros hostili more refertur3

Adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec

Alterutrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.

Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te, 65
Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.

Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tu,

Quid, de quoque viro, et cui dicas saepe videto.

Augustus is adding to the empire any
corner of the earth which is still outside
of it; an hyperbolical phrase, but describ-
ing rather what seemed iu progress than
particular events which had actually
occurred; but cp. Od. 4. 15. 13-16.

Italis, i. q. ‘ Ro1nanis,’ as ibid„ and
Epp. 2. 1. 2.

58-66. A last argument, and oue
which illustrates most clearly the
strictly personal bearing of the Epistle.
‘ With all your refinement we have heard
that you have a hobby of your own—
the war-garsie in which Actium is fought
over again on your father's lake. Be
sure your patron will enter into your
amusements, but you must let him feel
that you enter into his?

58. ne te retrahas ε for the formula
see on Od. 1. 33. 13 Epp. 1. 1.13,1.
16. 1.

absis, from the hunting-field.

59. extra numerum modumque,
literally‚ ‘ out oftime and tune? The two
words are used together in their literal
sense in A. P. 211, in a metaphorical
sense ¹(as here) in Epp. 2. 2. 144 ‘ verae
numerosque modosque ediscere vitae'3
cp. πλημμελής, ‘you‚ though such a
purist in matters of propriety, have
your own hobby in moments of relaxa-
tion.’

ouras fecisse: Epp. 1. 17. 5, Od. 3.
4. 51 n.

60. nugaris: Sat. 2. 1. 73, Epp. 2.
1. 93.

61. Lollius is represented as imitat-
ing, on a domestic scale, the public
‘naumachiae’z one of these is described
in Suet. Jul. Caes. 19, as having been
given by Julius Caesar, who made an
artificia] pieee of water sor the purpose

by the side of the Tiber. Augustus and
several of the emperors are also said to
have given these exhibitions, and they
became part of the shows of the Circus.

lintres : the pleasure boats, we may
suppose, on the piece of water in his
father's estate.

Aetia, the poetical form of ‘ Actiaca‚⁷
as in Virg. Aen. 3. 280.

62. pueros: doubtless, slaves.

64. velox, ‘till victory hastes to
crown.'

65. consentire suis studiis. These
two lines refer of course immediately to
those which precede: ‘ If you sympa-
thize with his hobby, he will with
yours’ ; but the words with which they
begin refer back also to v. 39, and so
serve to close the period.

66. utroque pollice. In Pliny’s
time we learn that ‘premere pollices’
had become a proverb for an expression
of favour, N. H. 28. 5. Whether it
was so in Horaee’s cannot be said. It
was derived apparently from the usage
of the amphitheatre, where the people,
according to Juv. S. 3. 36, signified their
pleasure as to the killing or sparing of
a gladiator by turning the thumb one
way or other.

67. protinus ut moneam, ⁸ to go on
with my lecture ’ ; an apology.

68. ‘ What, and of whom, and to
whom? ‘Tria dixit: quid dicas, de quo
dicas, eui dicas’ Porph. This punctua-
tion and interpretation is strongly sup-
ported by Bentley, who quotes Cic. in
Pis. 31. 75 ‘Tu quid, tu apud quos, tu
de quo dicas, intelligis.' It makes it
more clear that the warning is, not to
sreak rashly of your patron. If‘quo-
que ' were taken as the abl. of ‘ quisque '
