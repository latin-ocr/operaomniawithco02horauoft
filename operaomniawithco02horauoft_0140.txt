HORATII SATIRARUM

Accedent anni et tractari mollius aetas 85
Imbecilla volet; tibi quidnam accedet ad istam

Quam puer et validus praesumis mollitiem, seu

Dura valetudo inciderit seu tarda senectus?

Rancidum aprum antiqui laudabant, non quia nasus

Illis nullus erat sed credo hac mente, quod hospes 90
Tardius adveniens vitiatum commodius quam

Integrum edax dominus consumeret.

Hos utinam inter

Heroas natum tellus me prima tulisset!

Das aliquid famae quae carmine gratior aurem

Occupat humanam: grandes rhombi patinaeque 95
Grande ferunt una cum damno dedecus; adde

Iratum patruum, vicinos, te tibi iniquum,

Et frustra mortis cupidum, cum deerit egenti

As, laquei pretium.

against the MSS„ as suiting better ‘sive‚’
‘scu’; but perhaps the change is not
quite without point. ⁴ On a chance holid ay
or after an illness if so it be, and when
growing years ask for more generous
treatment? lt is not against this in a
poet that in v. 88 116 prefers another
point of view and couples illhealth and
old age under ‘ sive ’ and ‘senff

88. Note the ‘chiasmus' with which
‘ dura valetudo’ answers to ‘validus,’
‘ senectus ⁷ to ‘ puer.‘

89. Greediness is inconsistent with
true hospitality.

90. hac mente: Sat. 1. 1. 30. Cp.
with the passage Juv. S. 1. 140 ‘ quanta
est gula quae sibi totos Ponit apros, animal
propter convivia natum.’

92. integrum, opp. ‘vitiatum.'

93. prima, cp. Sat. 1. 3. 99 ‘primis
terris,' ‘ the young world.⁷

95. occupat. The reading is not cer-
tain. V had ‘ occupet,' and so have
many MSS. The subj. is given in K.
and H. Keller now supports ‘ occupat‚'
which also has the weight of Bentley and
Munro. Either would stand, ‘quae oc-
cupet ³ would be ‘ seeing that it falls on
human ears,' etc.; ‘ quae occupat ' is per-
haps simplet and therefore more likely,
‘ fame which falls‚' etc. ‘ Das ' is ‘ you
give, Ι suppose.' Some editors (as

‘Iure‚' inquit, ‘Trausius istis
Iurgatur verbis; ego vectigalia magna
Divitiasque habeo tribus amplas regibus.’

grandes, with ‘patinae’ as well as
‘rhombi’z eontrast ‘modica patella‚’
Epp. 1. 5. 2. The repetition of ‘ grandes
. . . grande' 15 emphatic and gives the
idea of proporti0n3 ‘the bigger the
dishes and the fish, the bigger the dis-
grace as well as the expense.'

96. For damno see on Od. 3. 5. 27,
and cp. Epp. 1. 18. 21, 2. Ι. 107.

97. patruum z the ‘ uncle ’ embodied
to a Roman the critical or censorious
disposition of a man's own family. Cp.
Od. 3.12. 3, Sat. 2. 3. 88, Pers. S. 1.11
‘Pertristis quidam patruus censor ma-
gister‚’ Cic. Cael. 11.

99. aS, laquei pretium. Perhaps
from Plaut. Pseudol. Ι. 1. 86 ‘ Ps. Sed
quid de drachma facere vis? C. Res-
tim volo mihi emere. Ps. Quam-
obrem? C. Qui me faciam pensilem?
The jest became proverbial; so Lucian,

interlocutor with no nom. cp. Sat. 1. 4.

Transius. An unknown name, stand-

travagant. It was a Roman name, as
inscriptions show.
