EPISTLE IV.

TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

ALBIUS to whom I owe thanks for your sair judgment of my Satires, Ι wonder
what you are doing at your country house—writing your excellent verses, or stroll<
ing in the forest, gaining health and meditating like a philosopher? You are a
happy man with all the gists outward and inward. Mind you keep to the true

Epicurean creed, as, if you will come to see me, you will find that I do.

A comparison with Od. 1. 35, which is also addressed to the poet Tibullus,
suggests that the enumeration of his :dvantages and the exhortation to imitate
Horace's philosophy of life have a definite personal purpose.

The contemporary epitaph on Tibullus by Domitius Marsus seems to imply
that he died about the same time as Virgil Ψ Te quoque Vergilio comitem non
aequa, Tibulle, Mors iuvenem campos misit in Elysios '), i. e. in 13.C. 19 or 18,
a date which will allow this Epistle to sall within the same limit with the others

which can be dated, i. e. before 13.C. 19.

ALEI, nostrorum sermonum candide iudex,
Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?
Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat,
An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,

1. sermonum. For Horace's use of
this term see Introd. to the Satires,
p. 6. It is impossible to prove that
Tibullus had not seen privately some of
Horace's ‘Sermones' of the new Epis-
tolary type, but the term must mean
here in the first instance the Satires : cp.
the address ‘candide Furni' Sat. 1. 10.
86, where he is contrasting sair and un-
fair criticism on his Satires. It was
there that he had been hurt and was sen-
sitive ε the tone of his Epistles was
not provocative of censure.

2. regione Pedana. For ‘regio‘
cp. Epp. 1. 15. 2. Pedum, a town which
in Horace's time was in decay, if it had
not already ceased to exist, is described
by the Scholiasts as between Tibur and
Praeneste, and this agrees with the no-
tice os it in Liv. 8. 13. The site is iden-
tified by Burn (Rome and Campagna, p.
388) with that of the modern village of
Gallicano. Caesar had a villa in its
neighbourhood : Cic. ad Att. 9. IS.
The locality of Tibullus' property is not
named elsewhere.

3. cassi Parmensis. See note on
Sat. 1. 10. 61 sor the strong arguments

against the Scholiasts' identification os
this person with the ‘ Etruscus Cassius‚'
the fluent ancl bad writer whose funeral
pile was formed of his own books. The
natural interpretation of the present
passage requires that the standard by
which Horace tries the poems of Tibul-
lus should be one which in the judgment
of both would imply a compliment.
The Pseudo-Acron (whose evidence
however is damaged by the above men—
tioned confusion of persons> says os Cas-
sius Parmensis ‘ hie aliquot generibus
stilum exercuit: inter quae opera ele-
giaca et epigrammata eius laudantur.’

opuscula. There is perhaps some
slight depreciatory meaning in the dimi-
nutive, as when Horace uses it of his
own Odes in Epp. Ι. 19. 35. It is used
in Plin. Epp. ὅ. 21 as the usual term
for the separate poems which compose a
book, ‘liber opusculis varius.'

4. tacitum carries the idea of quit-t
uninterrupted thought, as in Sat. 1. 3.
65, 1. 6. 123.

silvas inter. The edd. quote Tib. 4.
13. 9 (not however certainly a poem of
T ibullus) ‘ Sic—ego secretis possum bene
