Ante aras spargisque mola caput, improbe, salsa,

HORATII SATIRARUM

Rectum animi servas? ‘Quorsum?’ Insanus quid enim Aiax
Fecit cum stravit ferro pecus? Abstinuit vim

Uxore et gnato; mala multa precatus Atridis,

Non ille aut Teucrum aut ipsum violavit Ulixen.

‘ Verum ego,

ut haerentes adverso litore naves

Eriperem, prudens placavi sanguine divos.’

Nempe tuo, furiose.

‘Meo‚ sed non furiosus.’

Qui species alias veri scelerisque tumultu

their acts are paralleled. Ajax mistook
the sheep for his comrades. Agamem-
non treats his daughter as a heifer.

200. mola salsa, the salted grains of
spelt strewed on a victim before it was
sacrificed. Cp Virg. Aen. 2.133‘salsae
fruges ' It 1s a question whether (as the
poets assume) the Roman practice of
using salt was also a G1eek one.

201. rectum animi- ‘rectum ani-
mum.’ Heindorf quotes Ennius 111 Cic.
de Sen. 6 ‘mentes rectae quae stare
solebant‚’ opp. to ‘dementes' Cp. the
use of ὀρθός, and the phrase ‘ stas animo '
below, v. 213.

quorsum? The Scholiasts had this
reading (unless Porph. had‘ quorum ’,)
for they are puzzled by it, and give
various explanations.1f it is to stand
the explanation of the Comm. Cruq.
seems the best ‘sc. 10111115ἶ quid vis²
loquitur Agamemnon' ; so, at fuller
length, insat 2. 7. 21 ‘Non dices hodie
quorsum haec tam putida tenduntZ’ No
exact parallel is found for the abbre-
viation. Holder and Prof. Palmer
accept Bothe's ingenious emendation,

‘Rectum animi servas cursum ’2
insanus, ‘the madman, as you call
him.’

quid fecit eum stravit, ‘what did
his crime corne to when he butchered
the sheep 2 ' For the indie. perf. in this
use see Drager, Hist. Syntax. vol. 2.

202 abstinuit vim uxore. Orelli
quotes Ov. Met. 8. 751 ‘·fer1um Trio-
peius illa Abstinuit.’

203. uxore et gnato.
and Eurysaces.

204. non ille: cp. ‘ille non,' etc.
Od. 4. 6. 13 οὐκ ἐκεῖνός γε.

Teucrum. Ritter points out thatin
the Ajax of Sophocles Teucer is absent,
and does not return until after his bro-

Tecmessa

ther's death. Horace therefore is either
forgetful of this, or is following through-
out some other drama on the subject.

ipsum Ulixen, even Ulysses his
mortal enemy.

205. adverso, ‘the facing shore‚’ i. e.
the shore that faced the enemy-the
Greek shore.

206. prudens, i. e. quite knowing
what Ι was about. It is an answer to
the charge of madness. Cp. v. 89.

207. nempe. For this use of
‘nempe,' where a speaker ironically
completes the sentence of another, cp.
Epp. 1. 16. 75 n.

208. Bentley’s description of this line
perhaps still holds good, ‘locus lubri-
cus, quem nullus interpretum non at-
tigit, nullus dubium adhuc et incertum
non reliquit.⁷ For the reading, the large
preponderance of MS. authority must
be allowed to be in favour of veri as
against ‘ veris.’ V acc. to Cruquius had

‘veris' and the annotation ‘ contrarias
veritati.' but it had also <as have other
good MSS. which read 'veris') the
unintelligible ‘celeris,' and there were
signs of the s having been transferred
from the beginning of the later word to
the end of the earlier. With the read-
ing ‘ veri' the simplest explanation, if
it can stand, is that given by Heindorf,
who makes ‘ veri scelen‘sque' gen. after
‘species,' and ‘ alias veri scelerisque'=
‘alias veri, alias sceleris’ (no complete
parallel for this is quoted), ‘differing
ideas, now of right, now of wrong, mixed
up in confusion? ‘Species' are ‘ideas,'
but with the metaphor of sight not yet
lost, ‘imagesss ‘visions.' Cp. A. P. 25
‘decipimur specie recti⁷ ‘veri’ is used
for‘ moral right, as in Epp. 1. 12. 23· ‚
cp. v. 312 ot this Satire. Orelli and
Ritter give ‘veris,’ the constr. then
being

‘species alias veris,' ‘ideas at
