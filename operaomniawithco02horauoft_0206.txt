HORATII SATIRARUM

Quaeres quando iterum paveas iterumque perire

Possis, o toties servus!

Quae belua ruptis, 70

Cum semel effugit, reddit se prava catenis?

Non sum moechus, ais.

Neque ego hercule fur ubi vasa

Praetereo sapiens argentea: tolle periclum,

Iam vaga prosiliet frenis natura remotis.

Tune mihi dominus, rerum imperiis hominumque 75
Tot tantisque minor, quern ter vindicta quaterque
Imposita haud unquam misera formidine privet?

Adde super, dictis quod non levius valeat: nam

Sive vicarius est qui servo paret, uti mos

Vester ait, seu conservus, tibi quid sum ego? Nempe 80
Tu mihi qui imperitas alii servis miser atque

Duceris ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.

Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens sibi qui imperiosus,

76. minor, ἥττων, ‘at the mercy of.'

vindicta: the rod with which a
slave was touched in the legal form of
manumissi0n3 see Pers. Sat. 5. 75—88,
and ib. 124, 125.

77. formidine: first a slave's sear of
a masten bui in interpretation, the sear
which, according to the Stoic⁷ was in-
separable fron] desire, and which was
the essence of the ‘slavery' of the un—
emancipated soul; see Epp. Ι, 16. 65
‘ qui cupiet metuet quoque: porro Qui
metuens vivit liber mihi non erit un—
quam?

78. super: best taken (with Bentl.)
as =⁶ insuper '<01).Epp. 2. 2. 33), ⁵ dictis '
being the abl. of comparison after ‘le-
vius.y

nam: to our usage, redundant; as
’γάρ often is, where it justifies the asser-
tion that something will be said by
saying it.

79. vicarius: a slave was allowed
to purchase out of his ‘peculium' a
slave to himself to do his work. This
deputy was called ‘ vicarius ⁷: see Mart.
2. 18. 7, where a metaphorical use of the
custom is made similar to this one.

80. vester. Davus speaks of the
habits of the Roman world as standing
himself, as a slave, outside of it.

nempe, ‘ 1 will tell you ’; used with
some irony where the speaker after
asking a question answers it himself:
see inf. v. 107, and Epp. 1. 10. 22.

81. alii. The sing. has the better

authority (incl. V) as against ‘aliis’ It
is true that, when interpreted,the ‘ other
master' means his passions: but in ‘ alii
servis’ we are still within the metaphor,
and a slave had one master, not several.

82. alienis: ‘outside yourself„’ ‘which
another will pull.' Persius has the same
figure with reminiscence of this place,
5. 127 ‘ servitium acre Te nihil impel—
lit, nec quicquam extrinsecus intrat Quod
nervos agitet ⁷: see Conington's note
there. Bentley quotes the description
of marionettes from Apuleius, de Mund.
p. 125 ‘illi qui in ligneolis hominum
figuris gestus movent, quando filum
membri quod agitari solet traxerint
torquebitur cervix, nutabit caput, oculi
vibrabunt, totus videbitur vivere.5 Bent-
ley asked how the material of the pup-
pets was in point, and wished to accept
the conj. ‘signum’ for ‘lignum'; but
Orelli rightly answers that ⁶ lignum' is
intentionally contemptuous, ‘ a block of
wood‚' which owes any movement or
simulation of life entirely to the show-
man's strings.

83. sibi qui: the balance of MSS.
(incl. V) is sor ‘ sibi que'; the sense is
for ¹ qui7'which is read hy Bentl„ Orelli,
Ritter, Keller (Epilegomena‚ Holder
has ‘que'), and Munro; ‘sapiens' is
more forcible as the single answer to
the question ‘who 2 '—‘ The philosopher
of the Stoics,’—the other words give
thejustification of the answer. ‘ Sibi im-
periosus,' ἐγκρατήςε ‘qui imperat sibi,
