LIB. I.

SAT. 8. 89

Coeperunt; cruor in fossam confusus, ut inde

Manes elicerent, animas responsa daturas.

Lanea et effigies erat, altera cerea: maior 30
Lanea, quae poenis compesceret inferiorem;

Cerea suppliciter stabat servilibus ut quae

Iam peritura modis.

Hecaten vocat altera, saevam

Altera Tisiphonen3 serpentes atque videres

Infernas errare canes, Lunamque rubentem 35
Ne foret his testis post magna latere sepulcra.

Mentior at si quid merdis caput inquiner albis

Corvorum, atque in me veniat mictum atque cacatum
Iulius et fragilis Pediatia furque Voranus.

Singula quid memorem?

quo pacto alterna loquentes 40

Umbrae curn Sagana resonarent triste et acutum,

mother ofthe Eumenides, and her mighty
sister‚‘ Earth.

28. confusus, ‘ poured together, into
the treneh.’ He describes the process
of νεκυομαντεῖα Hom. Od. 11. 23 foll.
Spirits of the dead are invoked to tell
Canidia the destiny of her lover.

30. The two figures indicate respect-
ively Canidia andherlover. In allpoetical
descriptions of magic rites it is necessary
to the effect of mystery to leave much to
the imagination. Effigies of the person
to be affected appear in virg. Ecl. 8. 75,
Aen. 4. 508, a waxen image in Ov.
Her. 6. 91 ‘ [Medea] Devovet absentes,
simulacraque cerea (sc. Iasonis) fingit,
Et miserum tenues in iecur urget acus?
The meaning of the wax is obvious,
and is explained in Theoc. 2. 28 ὡς τοῦ·
τον τὸν καρόν ἐγὼ σὺν δαίμονι τάκω Ι ὣς
τάκοιθ’ ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ὁ Μύνδιος αὐτίκα Δέλ-
φις, and by Virg. l. c. The special mean-
ing of the wool as representing Canidia
is not so clear. According to Festus
(Paulus) s.v. ‘ Laneae’ it was the custom
at the Compitalia to distribute little
figures or dolls of wool, and the reason
given is that the Lares were supposed to
be ‘ animae hominum reductae in nume-
rum deorum? This may be connected.

maior quae. ‘ One of wool, the larger
of the two, that it might, etc.'

32· servilibus modis: ‘gravissimis
verberibus,' Aer. Cp. Liv. 32. 38 ‘in
servilem modum lacerati atque extorti.'
Others, as Dillf. punctuate so as to con—

nect ‘stabat servilibus modis,'but Orelli
rightly objeets to the rhythm and the
awkward double qualification of ‘stabat,’
‘ suppliciter servilibus modis.'

ut quae, sc. ‘stant ι’; for the ellipsis see
Sat. 1. 1. 25, 1. 3. 9. Some good MSS.
have ‘ utque’ which Munro gives.

34. atque couples ‘ serpentes ’ and
‘canes’ For the hellhounds that ac-
company Hecate cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 257
‘ visaeque canes ululare per umbram
Adventante dea,’ where Con. quotes Ap.
Rhod. 3. 1216 ἀμφὶ δὲ τήν γε (Hecate)
Ὀξεὶῃ ὑλακῇ χθόνιοι κύνες ἐφθέγγοντο.

35. rubentem, blushing to see such
sights, not as in Od. 2. 11. 10.

39. fragilis :⁴ mollis,' ‘effeminate'
Pediatia, acc, to the Schol., the con-
temptuous designation of one Pediatius,
aad a knight of ruined fortune and
character.

fur Voranus. The Schol. call him
‘libertus Q Lutatii Catuli‚’ and tell a
story of his robbing a money-changer’s
table, and hiding the coins in his shoe,
giving occasion, when he was discovered,
to the witticism of a bystander, ‘ belle '
inquit ‘ si te non ἐκχαλκεύει, hoc est
verberibus tanquam aes recudat, alludens
ad calceos] The story was a current one,
but it is attached by the Schol. on JuV.
S. 13. 111 to the ‘fugitivus scurra Ca-
tiilli.’

41. resonarent. Bentley objected to
the tense as contrasted with ‘ abdiderint,'
etc.‚ but the action in this one is more
continuous. He would read ‘ resonarint‚’
