HORATII SATIRARUM

Quorsum pertinuit stipare Platona Menandro,
Eupolin‚ Archilochum, comites educere tantos?

tepido, because it is winter.

Menandro : ablative; ‘to squeeze
Plato by putting Menander on the top of
him? The literature which Horace is
imagined as taking with him is what
would give material and spirit for writing
Satire. Plato, probably the philosopher
tcp. A. P. 310 ‘Socraticae chartae'), as a
treasury of character and moral ideas—
it has however been taken also for
Plato the comic poet ; Menander, as the
representative of Greek comedy 3 and the
lampoons of Archilochus, the earliest
type of poetical attack and caricature.
It should be remembered also that the
composition of the Epodes, in which
Archilochus was directly the model,
apparently was going on at the same
time as that of the Second Book of
Satires.

12. tantm, ‘ so bulky,' SchoL, prob-
ably rather as Heind., Orell., etc. ‘ such
great men.' It helps the human meta-
phor of ‘ comites educere.'

which your Satire brought on you, and
which you would appease by ceasing to
champion virtue? You will only be
despised.’

14. Siren: Hom.Od. 12. 39 f., treated
as an allegory of seductive pleasure, as
in Epp. 1. 2. 23.

15. quicquid parasti, i.e. the con-
sideration which you enjoy.

tonsore. The long beard was af-
fected by philosophers (Sat. 1. 3. 133,
infr. v. 35). Horace treats it as an in-
convenience which Damasippus would
fain get rid of. The ‘tonsor' would
trun it.

18. Ianum medium. The expres-
sion occurs twice in Cicero <de Off. 2.
25. 90, Phil. 6. 5. 15) and in both cases
of the place where monetary business
was transacted. Horace (Epp. 1. 1. 54)
has ‘ Ianus summus ab imo.² The exact
meaning is not certain. The Scholiasts’
notes are a combination of inconsistent
explanations. Bentley, followed by
Dyer (Dict. Geog. s.v. Rome) takes
‘Ianus' to have been the name of a
street, possibly a covered way or arcade,
near the Forum. ‘Summus ab imo'
meaning ‘ from end to end,’ and ‘ medius
Ianus ’ the middle of this arcade. Bum
(Rome and Campagna‚ p. 105) thinks
the reference is to arches &perhaps simi-
lar to the ‘Ianus Quadrifrons ' still stand-
ing in the Velabrum) on one side of the
Forum, used for the transaction of busi-
ness Livy (46. 27) speaks of Fulvius
Flaccus, as censor, undertaking amongst
other works ‘forum porticibus tabernisque
claudendum et Ianos tres faciendos.’
The passage is mutilated„ and it is un-
certain in what town these works were
executed‚ but if, as seems probable, it
was a provincial town, it is still of im-
portance, as the public works of pro-
vincial towns were usually imitations of
Rome. Cicero (de N. D. 2. 27. 67) ex-
plains ‘ Iani ’ as = ‘ transitiones per-
viae,’ and Livy (2. 49) gives the name
to the arch of a city gate.

curiosities,' the ποδανιπτὴρ used by Si-
syphus. The reference (as has been
