SAT. 3. 133

D. ‘ You are given to building, aping your betters, like the frog that would
be as large as an ox. You write poetry--you have a bad temper—you live
beyond your means—you are always sancying yourself in love.'

H. ⁴ Enough ! —we are both madmen; but the greater should have some mercy

on the smaller.⁷

‘SIC raro scribis, ut toto non quater anno
Membranam poscas, scriptorum quaeque retexens,
Iratus tibi quod vini somnique benignus

Nil dignum sermone canas.
Saturnalibus huc fugisti.

Dic aliquid dignum promissis: incipe.

Quid fiet? At ipsis
Sobrius ergo 5

Nil est:

Culpantur frustra calami, immeritusque laborat

Iratis natus paries dis atque poetis.

Atqui voltus erat multa et praeclara minantis

Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto. 10

1. Sic. The reading is doubtful;
the balance a little in favour of ‘si.'
On the other hand only some ofthe MSS.
which give ‘si' give ‘scribes,' which
seems necessary if it is to be a regular
conditional sentence. ‘ si scribes . ..quid
fiet?‘ But ‘ si' and ⁴ sic' are so fre-
quently interchanged (cp. Od. 1. 16. S
and Epp. 2. 2. 175, where ‘ sic ' is cer-
tain, yet ⁴ si ⁷ is found iu the best MSS.)
that weight must be given to the sense,
and this is surely for ‘ sic.' The condi-
tional sentence would be ill-balanced,
and on the other side the direct assault
in the opening words has more spirit.
With ‘sic’=‘ta1n' cp. Sat. 1. 5. 69
‘gracili sic tamque pusillo.’ For the
lengthened vowel in scribis see on
Od. 1. 3. 36.

2. membranam: the parchment is
here evidently for making a ‘ fair copy.’
Horace does not ask sor the parchment,
because he is for ever rubbing out again
what he writes on his ‘tabulae’ (Epp. 2.
2. 110), ‘saepe stilum vertens' (Sat. 1.
10. 72), in the metaphor he uses here
(ί retexens ³), treating it like Penelope’s
web. ‘ Membrana ' is used in the same
sense in A. P. 389. He is perhaps, un-
der cover of Damasippus' charges, sug-
gesting the true reason of the scantiness
of production of which his friends so
often complained, viz. his fastidiousness
of taste.

4. dignum sermone, λόγου ἄξιον,
but with the more definite meaning of

‘deserving to be talked of,' ‘Romana
venire in ora ’ Epp. 1. 3. 9.

at, so Bentley aster V, and most edi—
tors follow him, though K. and H. give
‘Abs ‘At‚⁷ as usual, introduces an
imagined answer‚ ⁴ Vou reply that, so
far from being the man of pleasure Ι de-
scribe, you have taken refuge in your
country-home from the revelry of the
Saturnalia in Rome. Wen then you
have no excuse for not composing—
begin. Nothing eomes, only excuses.'

5. With fugisti Saturnalibus, cp.
Juv. S. 7. 96 ⁴ vinum toto nescire De—
cembri,’ of the industrious poet.

6. dic, of poetical composition, as
usual in the Odes; see Od. 1. 32. gn„¹
3. 25. 7.

dignum promissis: A. Ρ. 138.
ΗΛ7. calami. Cp. the expansion of this
use Pers. S. 3. 10—20.

8. The unhappy wall suffers at the
hands of the poet in the throes of com-
position: cp. Pers. S. 1. 106 of poetry
that has eost no effort‚ ‘nee pluteum
caedit? For ‘natus' see on Od. 1.
27. 1.

iratis dis: Sat. 1. 5. 98. ‘Poetis’
comes as a comic παρὰ προσδοκίαν.

9. minantis: Epp. 1. 8. 3 ‘multa et
praeclara minantem’; like the Greek
ἀπειλεῖν, ‘ of loud or boastful pro-
mising.'

10. si cepisset: not quite the same
as the ‘temporal' use of ‘si' (see on
Epp. 1. 7. 10), for here he speaks of a
