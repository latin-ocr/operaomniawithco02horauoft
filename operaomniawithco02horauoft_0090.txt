HORATII SATIRARUM

Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare, docendum
Artes quas doceat quivis eques atque senator

Semet prognatos.

Vestem servosque sequentes,

In magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita
Ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos. 80

Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnes

Circum doctores aderat.

Quid multa?

Pudicum‚

Qui primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni

Non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoque turpi3

Nec timuit sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim 85
Si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor

Mercedes sequerer; neque ego essem questus: at hoc nunc
Laus illi debetur et a me gratia maior. 5

Nil me paeniteat sanum patris huius, eoque

‘ octonis‚' and being puzzled by it, got
out of the difficulty by treating ‘ octonis
Idibus ’ as a hypallage for ‘ octonos
asses Idibus‚' ίι’)παλλονγὴ, 1106 651 sin—
gulis Idibus referebant octonos asses
aeris pro mercede scholastica.' This is
very possibly the origin of the reading.
Some one who held this view indicated
it more briefly by writing ‘ octonos . . .
aeris' as a gloss over ‘ octonis . . . aera.‘
The assonance of ‘ octonos Idibus aeris ‘
is disagreeable. and one which Horace
avoids even iu his roughest hexame-
ters.

77 artes, branches of knowledge,
whlich Ovid (pont. 2. 9. 47) calls‘ in-
genuas artes,' grammar, rhetoric philo-
sophy, etc.

79. in magno ut populo, ‘as be-
fitted a great city.’ At Venusia he
might have gone as others carrying his
own books, 616. Cp Virg. Aen. 1. 148

‘magno in populo’‘ in some great city'
si qui vidisset. ..crederet Cp
Sat. 1. 3 57. The impst. subj. does
not deny the hypothesis, but is due to
the past time and the general statements z
‘ any one who saw would (was sure to)
believe.' The tense of ‘vidisset’ is be-
cause in present time it would be ‘vi-
derit⁷: believing 15 subsequent to seeing.

Cp. also (with Bentls Sat. 2. 3. 93.
avita, of two generations.

81. eustos ΖπαιδαὙω-γύςι 566 011 Sat.
1. 4. 118, and cp. A. P. 161. 239, Juv.
S. 7. 2 18 3 usually a confidential slave to
watch over a boy, take him to school,

keep him from harm, etc. Horace's
father will depute 1116 office to none.

83. primus, the first in point of time
—virtue must begin there.

84. His father's presence protected
him not only from temptation but from
scandal: turpi belongs to both sub-
stantives.

85. sibi vitio verteret si, a phrase
of Latin prose, Cic. Fam. 7. 6. 1,
‘ reckon it as a fault of his if.‘ For the
case of ‘ vitio ' see Madv. ξ 249.

86. praeco: Dict. Ant. s. v. It was
a specially despised calling. JuV. S. 7.
5 ‘nec foedum alii nec turpe putarent
Praecones fieri‚’ with Mayor’s note.
Cp. Epod. 4. 12, Sat. 2. 2. 47, Epp. 1.
7. 56, A. P. 419.

coactor, ‘collecton’ The term was
used in several eonnections. In this
case the Suetonian life of Horace fixes
its meaning by adding ‘exactionumss
i. e. the dues farmed bby ‘publicanis
See Cic pro Rab. Post. 11. 30, from which
we learn that a ‘'coactor was allowed
one per cent. on his collection.

87. at hoc. I have followed all the
editors (including Orelli, Ritter, Dillr„
Munro, and Holder) in altering the ‘ ad ’
of the MSS. and Aer. to‘ at,' and it is
an improvement3 but ‘ ad hoc’ (⁶ ad
haec' Cruq. giv‚es following‘ oneBland. ’ὅ
seems possible. 566 on Epod.9.16 and
Epp.1.19 45. In our reading‘ hoc'
is amative, as in v. 41 of the satire.

89. paeniteat, potential: see on Sat.

1. 5. 44.
