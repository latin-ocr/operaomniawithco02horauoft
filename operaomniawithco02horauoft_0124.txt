HORATII SATIRARUM

‘ Ter uncti

Transnanto Tiberim somno quibus est opus alto,
Irriguumquc mero sub noctem corpus habentO.

Aut si tantus amor scribendi te rapit aude 10
Caesaris invicti res dicere, multa laborum

Praemia laturus.'

Cupidum, pater optime, vires

Deficiunt: neque enim quivis horrentia pilis
Agmina nec fracta pereuntes cuspide Gallos

7. optimum erat3 see on Od. 1. 37.4.
It comes under the first head. ‘ Itis, all
the time, though 1 did not think so '; the
Greek ἄρ’ ἧν.

nequeo dormire. The humour con-
sists in the matter-of-fact old lawyer
taking this literally and prescribing for
physical sleeplessness. Poetical com-
position is often spoken of as a natural
rival of sleep: Epp. 2. 2. 54 ‘Ni dor-
mire putem melius quam scribere ver-
sus,' Juv. S. 1. 77 ‘ Quem patitur dor-
mire nurus corruptor avarae'? The ex-
planation is to be found in such expres-
sions as Hor. Epp. 2. 1. 112 ‘ prius orto
Sole vigil calamum et chartas et scrinia
posco,⁷ Juv. S. Ι. 51 ‘Venusina digna
lucerna,’ 7. 27 ‘ vigilata proelia‚' Aus.
Epigr. 34. 7 <of ineffective efforts at
composition) ‘Utilius dormire fuit quam
perdere somnum Atque oleum.’

uncti: see Od. 3. 12. 7 n. It is doubt-
ful whether the oil is a preliminary of
the bathing itself, or implies the exer-
cise which precedes it.

ter transnanto. Note the affecta·
tion of the imperative form common in
laws. Three is the mystical number
suitable to magical and to medical pre·
scriptions‚ Epp. 1. 1. 37, Virg. Ecl. 8.
73. Itis to be noticed also that both
swimming and deep drinking are sub-
jects of humorous allusion in Cicero's
extant letters to Trebatius (see Intro-
duction to this Safire), so that Horace is
giving Trebatius' advice a personal
colour.

9 irriguum: cp‘uvidusssOd. 2.19.
18, 4. 5. 39. It is the opposite of
‘siccus ’.Sat 2.2. 14. ‘Irriguumcorpus'
seems a step further, but it goes with
such expressions as that commented on
upon Od. 2. 2. 14. Cp. Phaedr. Fab. 4.

14. 9 ‘ irrigatus multo venas nectare.’

10. rapit: Od. 3. 2. 12, Epod. 7. 13.

Bentley preferred ‘capit,’ a reading of

slight authority, as more suitable to Tre-
batius.

aude, ‘have the courage, ' i.e. it is
a high undertaking. For this method
of giving panegyric under the form of
refusmg 1t see Od. 1. 6; 2. 12; 4 2.

11. invicti. Horace gives the title
to Achilles, Epod. 13. 12; to Jupiter,
Od. 3. 27. 7 3.

laborum praemia. Heind.‚ Orelli,
and Dillr. seek to sosten the apparent in-
delicacy by explaining ⁴ praemia ² either
of the worthiness of the subject, or of
the praise and popularity to be gained;
but it is simpler to notice that the words
are in Trebatius' mouth. He may be
supposed without offence to take even
a mercenary view of the poet's ealling;
but he is specially concerned in pointing
by contrast the thanklessness of his pre-
sent style of composition. Horace does
not profess to look upon the suggestion
as having any practical bearing on him-
self.

12. pater. Cp. Epp. 1. 6. 543 see
on v. 60.

13. neque quivis, a favourite form;
Epp. 1. 17. 36, A. P. 263.

14. fracta cuspide3 often explained
after the Schol., of a stratagem such
as that of Marius, who, according to
Plutarch, in the war with the Cimbri
substituted a fragile wooden peg for one
of the two iron pegs which fastened
the head of the ‘ pilum ² to its shaft, in
order that when it struck, the weaker
peg breaking and the other bending,
the javelin might be doubled on the
enemy's shield, and so be difficult to
extract and encumber his movements.
This however, as seems to be conclusively
argued by Funkhaenel (see Orelli's
exeursus‘s, is too farfetched‚ special, and
technical a reference to be looked for.
The alternative seems to be, with him, to
suppose ‘ cuspide' to be a generic name
