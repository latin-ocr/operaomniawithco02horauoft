HORATII SATIRARUM

Ac mihi seu longum post tempus venerat hospes,
Sive operum vacuo gratus conviva per imbrem

Vicinus, bene erat non piscibus urbe petitis,

120

Sed pullo atque haed03 turn pensilis uva secundas

Et nux ornabat mensas cum duplice ficu.

Post hoc ludus erat culpa potare magistra,

Ac venerata Ceres, ita culmo surgeret alto,

Explicuit vino contractae seria frontis. 125
Saeviat atque novos moveat Fortuna tumultusf,

Quantum hinc imminuet? Quanto aut ego parcius aut vos,
O pueri, nituistis ut huc novus incola venit?

Nam propriae telluris herum natura neque illum

Nec me nec quemquam statuit: nos expulit ille;

Illum aut nequities aut vafri inscitia iuris,
Postremum expellet certe vivacior heres.

119. operum vacuo, explained by
‘ per imbrem,’ on a day of enforced idle-
ness. ¹ Frigidus agricolam si quando
continet imber ' Virg. G. 1. 259, though
Virgil points out that the said husband-
man need not be altogether idle at such
times. For the gen. cp. ⁶ operum solu-
tis⁷ Od.3.17.16.

120v bene erat, ‘we made merry’3
cp. Sat. 2. 8. 4 ‘fuerit melius,’ id. 19
‘ pulcre fuerit,' and above v. 82 ‘ ad
melius transcurrere? For these ‘dapes
inemptae' added to the supper on ocea-
sions cp. Epod. 2. 48 foll. and the poem
of Martial (10. 48) above referred to.

121. pensilis, ⁶ hung‚' i.e. ‘to dry as
raisins'; cp. Sat. 2. 4. 72.

secundas mensas, ‘the second
course.' ‘ Alteris mensis ’ Od. 4. 5. 31,
‘ mensis secundis’ Virg. G. 2. 101.

122. duplice, ‘ bifida.’ Schol. ‘ split‚’
probably to dry.

12 3. eulpa magistra. Porph. ex-
plains these words by ¹ libere, sine archi-
posia‚’ without. that is, a ‘ magister’ or
‘ arbiter bibendi! His explanation sug-
gests, though it does not say, that ‘culpa’
had some known technical sense. Va-
rious attempts have been made to guess
at one; as that it refers to some game
of forfeits where the (pleasantl penalty
was to drink a cup oswine. The form
‘ culpa magistra ‘ is then dietated by the
figure ofthe ‘ magister bibendis ‘to drink
when [not a formal president of the
feast but] a breach of rules (sc. a forfeit)

bade us.' That some sense of the infor-
mality and freedom of the drinking is at
the bottom of the expression is likely
from Horaee's description of his own
table (Sat. 2. 6. 68), where each guest
drinks as he likes‚ ‘ solutus legibus in-
sanis.’ Bentley, dissatisfied with all
suggestions, would alter ‘culpa’ to
‘cupa,’ i.e. ‘copa,⁷ ‘ a tavern mistress.'
and many other emendations have been
suggested. Perhaps they all lose the
force of ‘ ludus erat,⁷ which seems hardly
to describe simple drinking.

124. venerata, addressed with the
prayer ‘ so might she rise? ‘ Venerata ’
pass. as in Virg. Aen. 5. 460, see on
‘ metato ’ supr. v. 114.

ita. so, as the prayer or libation was
duly offered—a formula of prayer, as ‘ sie'
in Od. 1. 3. 1.

surgeret, the prayer ‘ surgas’ quoted
in orat. obl.

125. explicuit, Od. 3. 29. 14 ‘ solli—
citam explicuere f1·ontem.’

127. hinc, ‘from our present con-
dition.'

128* nstuistis, of being in good
case, as ‘ nitidus ’ Epp. 1. 4. 15.

ut, ‘from the time when,⁷ Od. 4. 4.
42, Epod. 7. 19, Sat. 1. 6. 27.

129. propriae, pred. ‘as true pro-
perty'; cp. the use of the word in v. 134
and Od. 2. 2. 22, Sat. 2. 6. 5.

131. vafri iuris, of the law with its
subtle‘ties. Cp. ‘ius anceps' Sat. 2. 5.
