Ex testamento sic est elata:

HORATII SATIRARUM

cadaver 85

Unctum oleo largo nudis humeris tulit heres,
Scilicet elabi si posset mortua; credo

Quod nimium institerat viventi.

Cautus adito :

Neu desis operae neve immoderatus abundes.
Difficilem et morosum offendet garrulus; ultro 90

Non etiam sileas.

Davus sis comicus atque

Stes capite obstipo, multum similis metuenti.

Obsequio grassare3 mone, si increbruit aura,

Cautus uti velet carum caput ; extrahe turba

Oppositis humeris; aurem substringe loquaci. 95
Importunus amat laudari3 donec Ohe! iam

Ad caelum manibus sublatis dixerit, urge,

testator's sepulture3 but this indicates
that such instructions were not uncom-
mon. Whether the present story is
more than a caricature we cannot pro-
nounce.

improba, ἀναιδής.

87. scilieet, explaining her motive in
the condition.

si, ‘to see if she could! There was
a variant in V, ‘ut sie‚' possible, but
more likely to be a gloss than ‘ si.'

89. neu desis . . . neve abundes.
It is possible to take these as final or
interpretative clauses after the previous
imperative, but it is simpler to take them
independently. See on v. 17 of this
Satire.

abundes is used absolutely, but an
abl. or gen. of respect can be supplied
in sense from ‘operae‚' ‘be unmeasured
and overflowing in your zeal.’

90. difficilem: A. P. 173.

morosum: Od. 1. 9. 18 ‘morosa
canities,' ⁴ moody.' Cicero couples the
two adjectives‚ Orat. ²9·

ultro, sc. ‘ quam ut garrulitatem vites.’

91. non sileas, The form of the
advice is sostened to a potential; but
here as in the somewhat similar cases
with the third person (Epp. 1. 18. 72,
Virg. G. 3. 140, Aen. 12. 78 ; see Wag-
ner's note there, and cp. Drager, Hist.
Syntax 1. p. 286), there is a special ern-
phasis on the negative giving it a stronger
force of contrast. ‘Be cautious, ete.,
. . . but this does not mean that you
will go into the other extreme and be
silent.'

Davus comicus: ‘the Davus (i.e. the

slave) of the comie stage.’ So ‘ comicus '
Cic. Rosc. Am. 16. 47. Cp. ‘tragicus
Telephus ’ A. P. 95. Davus is the name
of Horace's own slave in Sat. 7, who is
there represented (except during the Sa-
turnalia) as ⁶ multum similis metuenti ';
see vv. 1, 2. We do not know of any
reference to a special comedy.

92. eapite obstipo, ‘bent head.' Pers.
S. 3. 80 ‘ obstipo capite et figentes
lumine terram.’

multum, with ‘ similis‚' as ‘multum
dissimiles ⁷ Epp. Ι. 10. 3.

93. grassare, ‘ proceed‚' ‘ make your
approaches‚' as frequently in Livy, ‘iure
non vi grassari ' 3. 44, etc.

increbruit: ‘ has freshened.’ Cic.
ad Fam. 7. 20. 3 ‘ventus increbrescit,’
Virg. A. 3. 530 ‘ crebrescunt aurae.'

95. substringe. Itis doubtful whether
the expression is literal, of the actual
attitude of a hearer who is rather deaf
or fears to miss a word, holding the ear
with his hand below it, or metaphorical,
as Quintil. 10. 5. 4 ‘ effusa substringere,’
‘hold your ear fast) i. e. do not allow
your attention to wander; ‘subiunge‚
patienter audi ’ Schol.

96. importunus amat: ‘is eager in
season and out of season.’

Ohe. Pers. S. 1. 2 3 ‘ dicas cute per-
ditus, Ohe 1' The fuller phrase is ‘Ohe
iam satis est’ Sat. 1. 5. 1 2. Orelli and
others make ‘ ohe iam ! ² the exclamation;
but the quotation from Persius makes
sor ‘ ohe!' ‘ Iam’ then qualifies ‘dixerit’;
‘till he already shall list his hands to
heaven and cry “ hold !'''
