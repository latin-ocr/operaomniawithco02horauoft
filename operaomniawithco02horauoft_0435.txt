HORATII ARS

POETICA. 419

Interdum speciosa locis morataque recte

Fabula nullius veneris, sine pondere et arte,

320

Valdius oblectat populum meliusque moratur
Quam versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae.
Grais ingenium, Grais dedit ore rotundo
Musa loqui, praeter laudem nullius avaris.

Romani pueri longis rationibus assem

imitatorem in the sense of Aristotle’s
μιμητής, the poet, as ·' holding the mirror
up to nature?

vivas ducere voces, i. e. make his
characters talk like living persons.

319—323. In fact. for a Roman au-
dience, it is often this moral side of a
play rather than the artistic side which
secures success,

319. loeis, as in Cicero, for ‘locis
communibus ' in the rhetorical sense,
‘ commonplaces‚' that is, passages ofrhe-
toric (or, as herc, of moral import) which
do not belong vitally to the place where
they occur, but may be transferred from
one composition to another. A play
which is ‘ speciosa locis’ is one in which
these moral commonplaces stand in re-
lief. So Quintilian recommends Euri-
pides to the study of Roman orators
as being ‘ sententiis densus‚' full of γνῶ-
μαι, sententious commonplaces, which
can be brought into a speech as re-
quired.

morata, ¹ supplied with characters.’

320. ‘ Though without beauty, solid
value, or artistic skill.’

322. inopes rerum, ‘devoid of sub-
stance.' This phrase and the following
one are dranmtic, such as the moral but
inartistic audience would use ε compare
his use of conventional epithets‚ sor
’ which he does not vouch, in Epp. 2. 1.
50 f.‚ and inf. v. 341.

323—345. ⁶ The Greeks have to the full
the artistic mind. The Romans are too
practical, as their education shows, and
sor practical life arithmetic pays better
than poetry. Poetry has two aims-—to
instruct and to give delight. You may
pursue either of these separately. If so,
Ι can only say, isit be preaching, do not
let it be longwinded, if it be amuse-
ment, do not let it be extravagant. But
remember that if you pursue either aim
by itself‚ you only please part even of
your present audience. The truly popu-
lar poet, popular with all classes and
also in all countries and for all time, is

325

the poet who combines the Greek and
the Roman ideal, who delights his reader
even while he instructs him.'

The comparison between the Greek
and Roman genius will naturally be com-
pared with Epp. 2. Ι. 93 f. His recog-
nition of the strength of the Greek on
the artistic side is here more direct, not
veiled ‚as there,under half-ironical terms,
‘nugari,’ ‘in vitium labier? etc.; his
criticism of the weakness of the Roman
conception of practical lise is also more
explicit and satirical in tone: but his
point is not to praise or blame either in
this place. but to hold up to the Roman
poet the duty of facing both sides of
his duty.

323. ingenium: the native gift3
what native gift. is understood from the
context. The Greeks (Horace is think-
ing os the race as a whole, not os his
contemporaries) have the poetic spirit
by nature. They are, as Aristotle would
say, εὐφυεῖς. Α Roman is less favoured
and needs more study and effort; but,
alas! his education drives himin another
direction.

ore rotundo: of style; in smooth‚
finished, artistic expression ; a transl. of
τὰ στρογγύλον, of which the meaning is
made clear in Plat. Phaedr. p. 234 E ὡς τὰ
δέοντα εἰρηκότος τοῦ ποιητοῦ, οὐκ ἐκείνῃ
μόνον, ὅτι σαφῆ καὶ στρογγύλα καὶ ἀκρι-
βῶς ἕκαστα τῶν ὀνομάτων ἀποτετόρ-
νευται; so ‘apte et rotunde’ Cic. de
Fin. 4. 3. 7. As wilkins notices, it has
nearly the opposite sense to that osten
given to it in popular quotation.

324. praeter laudem nullius ava-
ris 2 devoted to φιλοτιμία and no meaner
form of eovetousness.

325 f. Cp. Plato's remark in admit-
ting Arithmetic to his ideal educa-
tion, that it is to be studied in the
spirit of a philosopher, not of a shop—
keeper: τοῦ ’γνωρίζειν“ ένεκα, ἀλλὰ μὴ τοῦ
καπηλεύειν Republ. p. 525; and his corn
plaint‚ that even those w ho studied phi-
losophy in early youth did so only in
