LIB. l.

EPIST. 16.

Introrsum turpem, speciosum pelle decora. 45
‘Nec furtum feci nec fugi,’ si mihi dicat

Servus, ‘Habes pretium, loris non ureris,' aiO.

‘Non hominem occidi.’ ‘Non pasces in cruce corvos.’

‘Sum bonus et frugi.'

{enuit negitatque Sabellus:

Cautus enim metuit f0veam lupus accipiterque 50
Suspectos laqueos et opertum miluus hamum.

Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore3

Tu nihil admittes in te formidine poenae:

Sit spes fallendi, miscebis sacra profanis.

Nam de mille fabae modiis cum surripis unum, 55
Damnum cst non facinus mihi pacto lenius isto.

Vir bonus, omne forum quem spectat et omne tribunal,
Quandocumque deos vel porco vel bove placat,

Iane pater! clare, clare cum dixit, Apollo!

45. speciosum pelle deeora: see
on Sat. 2. Ι. 64, where many of the
words recur.

46-49. ‘Freedom from some gross
faults is not moral perfection.'

46. dicat. The great majority of MSS.
have the subj.‚ Regin. nearly alone the
ind.,which Bentl. and Munro follow. It
is however impossible to clear away these
irregular hypothetica] correspondences
from Horace. Cp.Od. 3. 3. 7 ‘illabatur . . .
ferient.' Epp.2. 1. 108 ‘ sitaceas, laudant?
‘Ai0,' ‘my answeris‚’ is substituted for ‘my
answer would be.' See Madv. ξ 348. b.

47. ureris z cp. ‘ peruste funibus'
Epod. 4. 3.

49. frugi: ‘the proper virtue of a
slave'3 Sat. 2. 7. 3.

negitatque: rightly restored to the
text by Bentl. from V. It is really the
reading of the best MSS, though many
have ‘negat atque.’ The frequentative
has its proper force, ‘shakes his head
and saysno! no! nol’

Sabellus, ‘one of us Sabines,' i. e.
⁶ a farmer of the plain, hard-headed sort.'

50, 51. ‘Such a man is only like
beasts and birds of prey and greedy
fishes. checked not by conscience but by
fear of unseen snares.’ Notice that, in
Horace's manner (see on Od. 4. 9. 20 fi),
the words necessary to the full idea,
‘ cautus‚' ‘ suspectos,’ ‘ opertum‚’ are dis-
tributed between the clauses.

51. miluus: atrisyll. See on Epod.

16. 32.

53. tu: see above on vv. 41—43.

admittes in te. ‘ Ea in te admisisti
quae,’ etc. Cic. Phil. 2. 19. 47.

54. miscebis saera profanis, i. e.
‘you will know no distinction of right
and wrong.⁷ Cp. A. P. 396, where it is
said to have been the work of wisdom
‘ secernere sacra profanis?

55. nam justifies not what has been
said but the implied thought, · and what
good is such limitation of your wrong-
doing ? VVickedness is a matter of
quality not quantity.’ Horace is falling
into the language with which a Stoic
would support the paradox &that all
offences are equal ') in which he expressed
this truth. VVhether he has the paradox
actually in view is doubtful. The figure
used is suggested by the dialogue with
a slave in vv. 46—49.

fabae: the sing. as a collective noun :
so in Ennius, Ann. 545 ‘perque fabam
repunt.'

57. vir bonus, etc. This ‘ good man'
of vv. 41—43‚ the ideal of respectability
to all who see him offering surety at the
bankers or giving evidence before the
praetor's chair.

58. placat: see on Od. 1. 36. 2.

vel porco vel bove : ‘ whether with
a smaller or a larger offering.’

59. Compare with this passage the
imitation in Persius S. 2. 8. For Iane
pater cp. Sat. 2. 6. 20.
