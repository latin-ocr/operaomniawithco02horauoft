46 HORATII SATIRARUM

Nec vincet ratio hoc, tantundem ut peccet idemque

Qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti

Et qui nocturnus sacra divum legerit.

Regula peccatis quae poenas irroget aequas,
Ne scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello.

Nam ut ferula caedas meritum maiora subire

Verbera non vereor, curn dicas esse pares res
Furta latrociniis, et magnis parva mineris
Falce recisurum simili te, 51 tibi regnum

Permittant homines.

115. vincet. Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 225. A
Lucretian use, 5. 735 ‘ ratione docere et
vincere verbis ’ 3 but it is found in Cicero,
as pro Clu. 44. 124; so ‘evinco' Sat.
2. 3. 250.

116. fregerit. Cp. ‘fragili myrt0,'
‘ easily plueked,' Od. 3. 23. 16. The in-
5130005 were probably proverbial, as
Plutarch (Solon. 17) says of Draco’s
laws, that the same penalty, death, was
fixed τοῖς λάχανα κλέψασιν 311(1 τοῖς
ἱεροσύλοις.

117. nocturnus.

sacra legerit: ‘legere’ is used by
Lucilius' 1n the sense of to steal) The
meaning remains 111 the adj ‘sacrilegus'

119. scutica, ‘a leather thong,5 an
instrument like the ‘ferula,¹ of school

1110111 of punishment. Cic pro Ixab. 4.

giant fennel, used as a cane. See May 01 5

your striking with a 03110 0110 who de—
serves to susser severe punishment, Ι have
no fears of that? The separation of ‘ut
caedas ’ from ‘ vereor,' and the fact that
it precedes instead of following, soften
the departure from the usual rule which
would have required ‘ne' instead of ⁶ ut.'
The construction is as though ‘illud’
explained by ·' ut caedas ’ were the obj.
of ‘ vereor? Cp. Liv. 28. 22 ‘nihil

minus quam ut egredi moenibus auderent
timeri poterat.’ Mr. Haskins (Journal
os Philology vol. 7. p. 263) 1135, how·
ever, proposed to take ‘ut‘ in its usual
sense z ‘I have no sear of your not [even]
punishing with the rod‚' etc„ i.e. Ι 3111
1101 afraid of your letting off altogether ς
and this may be right.

121. cum dieas, ‘ when you say,' in
orat. obl.‚ as it qualifies the clause that
follows ‘ non vereor3' ‘when you hold
that doctrine of the equality of offences,
1 well understand that it means a
levelling up, not down3 a doctrine of
severity, not laxity.'

1 22. furta, latrociniis, (cp. 106>
theft with, or without, violence.

magnis, dat. aster ‘ simili '; in exact
language it would be ‘ei salci qua
magna recisurus sis.’

123. falce, ‘ pruning-hook.'

124 soll. Having put into the mouth
of the Stoie the profession of what he
would do if he were made king, Horace
takes the occasion which he has made
to laugh at a second Stoic paradox—
that the wise man is a king ’(500 110105 011
Od. 3. 2. 17-20, 4. 9. 393 Epp. 1. 1.
107). The Scholiasts quote from Luci—
lius (1110. 134) ‘nondum etiam qui haec
omnia habebit, Formosus, dives, liber,
rex 501115 feretur?' —a passage 11 hich it
seems clear Horace 1135 111 view.

dives. Cicero ‹Paradox 6) discusses
the Stoic paradox ‘solum sapientem esse
divitem.' Cp. id. ad Fam. 7. 16.

125. sutor bonus, an ad invidiam
illustration of the doctrine that the

ideal wise man is the master of every
art.
