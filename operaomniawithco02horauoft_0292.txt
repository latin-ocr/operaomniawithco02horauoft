HORATII EPISTULARUM

Quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patres, '
Certemus spinas animone ego fortius an tu

Evellas agro, et melior sit Horatius an res. 5
Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et cura moratur

Fratrem maerentis, rapto de fratre dolentis

Insolabiliter‚ tamen istuc mens animusque

Fert et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.

scribing the occupatior] of Horace's do-
main before it came into his hands⁴
‘ though it has been the dwelling-place
os five liouseholds‚' etc. They explain
‘ patres’ in the next line by ‘ senatores,’
meaning probably ‘ decuriones⁷ or
members of the municipal council os
Yaria. This view is espoused fully by
Dilis. Ritter and Obbar follow it in
respect of the time of‘ habitatum.' On
the other hand Orelli takes ‘ habitatum ⁷
as a quasi-present part. (‘ though it is
the dwelling-place')‚ explaining ⁸ patres'
by ‘patres-familiarum,⁷ and supposing
them to have been ‘ fortes mercede
coloni' (Sat. 2. 2. 115), free tenants
working parts of Horace's estate and
sharing the produce with him or paying
rent. The eight slaves of Sat. 2. 6. [18
must then have been occupied with what
we might call the ‘home sarm.' The
strongest arguments in favour of Orelli's
view is the omission of the temporal
adverb which the Scholiasts supply,
and which seems needed for clearness.
Against it may be said (17 that it
makes the estate ‘habitatum quinque
focis‚’ something different from the
estate otherwise spoken of, for which
the ‘vilicus’ is responsible: ⁴ agelli
quem fastidis habitatum’ becomes ⁵ the
little farm which you despise, though
[part of] it is the dwelling-place of five
households? (2) That there is more ap-
priateness in Horace’s telling the ‘ vili-
cus’ a piece of the earlier history of the
land now in his occupatiori, than a fact
which was as well known to one as to
the other.

3. Variam: hod. Vico Varo, in the
valley of the Anio, where the Licenza

joins it. If the ‘patres‘ are ‘ heads of
households,' not ‘ decuriones‚’ they may
be supposed to visit Varia as their
market town.

4. certemus, Notice that the chal-
lenge gives a playsul air to the Epistle
-also that it implies a compliment to
the bailiff’s energy in farming. Surely
Orelli misreads it in thinking that the
suggestion is that he is lazy in weed<
111σ.

*spinas : for the metaphor cp. Epp. 2.
2. 212, also Sat. 1. 3. 35. For the posi-
tion osne cp. Epp. 2. 2. 65.

5. melior, ⁴ in better condition?

res, ‘ his property.’ There are to be
two comparisons‚ between the energy of
their respective work and its success.

6. For Lamia see introd. to Odes 1.
26 and 3. 17. There is nothing to prove
or disprove their identity.

moratur, ‘keeps me awhile in town?
The feeling of this reference to Lamia's
sorrow and Horace's syrnpaffiy, though
it would be rather incongruous in a
letter actually intended for the ‘ vilicus‚⁷
is natural and appropriate if we look on
the Epistle as intended rather for the
eyes of the poet's friends 55.

8. istuc, ‘to where you are,’ sc. to
the country ; so ‘ istic’ in v. 37.

mens animusque: the accumulation
seems to mean ‘every impulse of my
soul.‘ Cp. the frequent phrase ‘ animus
fert ; ' and so ‘ mens tulit’ Stat. Theb. 4.
7533 cp. ‘mens’=inelination‚ Epp. 1.
1. 4.

9. amat: see on Od. 2. 3. 15.

spatiis obstantia claustra, ‘ the
doors that bar its course ’ ; ‘ claustra ’=
‘ carceres'; see Sat. 1. 1. 114.

⁴* Dr. Verrall, in his ‘studies in Horace,' has an ingenious chapter in which he argues that
the Lamia of this Epistle and the two Odes is none other than the ‘vilicus' himself, the
name being here substituted for the personal pronoun, as ‘Horatius’ for ‘ego’ in the pre-
ceding line. It follows that ‘ moratur' and ¹ istuc fert ¹ must mean ‘ hinders me from’ and ‘drives
me to' the discussion to follow. This is in itself an objection to the view. The words are
singularly unlike Horace’s usual ironical way of entering upon a philosophical lecture. There
is also the same difficulty which weighs against the reading ‘Pulliae' in Od. 3. 4. 10, the un-
likelihood of such a personal detail in the poet's life having escaped notice in early times. It
also makes the ‘vilicus' a much more important person in the Epistle than on our theory he is.
