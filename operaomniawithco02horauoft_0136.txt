Proceros odisse lupos?

HORATII SATIRARUM

Quia scilicet illis

Maiorem natura modum dedit, his breve pondus.
Ieiunus raro stomachus volgaria temnit.
‘ Porrectum magno magnum spectare catino

Vellem‚' ait Harpyiis gula digna rapacibus,

At vos, 40

Praesentes Austri, coquite horum obsonia,—quamquam
Putet aper rhombusque recens, mala copia quando
Aegrum sollicitat stomachum, cum rapula plenus

Atque acidas mavolt inulas.

so. what is the principle, the purpose?

you like in each case what is unna'tural.

37. his, sc. ‘mullis ’; see also on vv.
29, 30; ⁶ hic’ is used of the nearest to
the speaker's mind even when it was the
first mentioned: cp. Epp. 1. 17. 19. The
‘mullus' is here the main subject, as
we see by his returning to it in v. 39,
without again mentioningit. The ‘ lupi'
have only been introduced as an illustra-
tion of the inconsistency of the reason
sor liking the mullet large.

38. The edd. generally (adv. Holder)
are no doubt right in joining ‘raro ieiu-
nus,' ‘ which seldom seels real hunger';
cp. vv. 14, 15. Aer. mentions and
prefers an ingenious variant ‘ rari‚' con-
structed aster ‘ ieiunus} ‘hungry for
rarity.’

39. An alternative explanation put
into the mouth of the epicure himself.
No, it is not fasfidiousness, it is pure
greediness ‘I should like, if it were
only possible, nota three pound mullet,
but one that should try the capacity of
the host's dishes.’

porrectum. sat. 2. 8. 43.

magno magnum. PerhapS, as Prof.
Palmer suggestS, there is a mock heroic
echo of Homer's μέγας μεγαλωστί; but
cp. inf. v. 95, where there is a similar
mocking repetition, ‘grandes . . . grande‚'
in satin‘zing the fancy for size. It is an
anticipation of Juvenal's Satire on the
‘spatium admirabile rhombi‚’ and the
dish made to order to match it.

and disgusting.

at. A good instance of the use in an
appeal, spoken of on Epod. 5. 1.

41. praesentes, ‘ potentes ' Schol.
Virg. Aen. 9. 404 ‘ Tu dea tu praesens
nostro succurre labori.' They are ad-
dressed as divine powers.

coquite, ironically‚ ‘ spoil them.’

quamquam : ‘ corripit se, quasi frus—
tra austros vocaverit, curn luxuriosis

42. quando. Taken by Orelli and
others as causal3 but this throws too
much emphasis on the clause introduced
by ‘cum.' Both conjunctions are tem-
poral, ‘quando ' giving the occasion;
⁴ dainties, however fresh, lose their savour
when the plenty only worries a wearied
stomach’ z ‘ curn ’ adding a circumstance
which characterises the same moment.
‘ a time when it looks rather for stimu-
lants.

43. rapula, with the epithet ‘acria'
Sat. 2. 8. 8, some kind of radishes.

44. inulas, ‘ amaras ' Sat. 2. 8. 51; cp,
Lucr. 2. 430, probably elecampane, Inula
Helenium of Linnaeus. The root is
edible‚ and has an aeid taste. The
Schol. however explain acidas by the
fact that they were dressed with
vmegar.

tration of the capriciousness of luxury.

life.

46. nigris. The epithet recalls them
to the eye—so it has the force of ‘the
olive that you know, the same plain un-
comely olive that the poor eat.'
