Caelatumque novem Musis opus1'

HORATII EPISTULARUM

Aspice primum,

Quanto cum fastu, quanto molimine circum-

Spectemus vacuam Romanis vatibus aedem!

Mox etiam, si forte vacas, sequere et procul audi, 95
Quid ferat et quare sibi nectat uterque coronam.

Caedimus et totidem plagis consumimus hostem

Lento Samnites ad lumina prima duello.

Discedo Alcaeus puncto illius;
Si plus adposcere visus,

Quis nisi Callimachus?

ille meo quis?

Fit Mimnermus et optivo cognomine crescit.
Multa fero, ut placem genus irritabile vatum,
Cum scribo et supplex populi suffragia capto;
Idem, finitis studiis et mente recepta,

strut about the Palatine library and
choose places for our books and busts.
If you get near enough to listen you may
hear Propertius calling me an Alcaeus,
and [if he does that unlikely thing] I
will call him, not only, as he calls him-
self, a Callimachus. but even a Mim-
nermus, to his heart’s content)

mirabile visu, etc. τ an exclamation
which each poet is supposed to make on
reading the poems of the other.

part. ‘a piece of fine graving from the
Muses' hands.’ With the fig. cp. that of
A. P. 441 ‘ male tornatos incudi reddere
versus.' Bentley wished to take the
words with the following lines, in appo-
sition to ⁶ aedem‚’ so that as they stand
they would mean ‘ ornamented with the
nine Muses carved in relief’ ; but he would
also alter caelatum to ‘ sacratu1n.’
For the division of circum-spectemus
cp. A. P. 424 ‘ inter-Noscere.'

94. vacuam Romanis vatibus ae—
dem, ‘the temple with its vacant room
sor Roman bards,' i. e. the Palatine
temple and library (Epp. 1. 3. 17, Od.
1. gll. The library is ready and well
stocked with Greek poetry. Latin con-
tributions are slow to come in, and those
poets who are admitted think much of
the compliment.

95. si forte vacas : ⁴ it is not worth
interrupting serious business sor.y

procul: not coming too near.

and with thwack for thwack wear out

described is a duel of insincere criticism

and compliments between the two poets
who read their compositions to one
another (seev. 105) all day ‘adlumina
prima ’compared with Sat. 2. 7. 33 ‘sub
lumina prima venire convii am, will
mean ‘till supper times The Scholiasts
were in doubt as to the meaning of
‘ Samnites ’ ; of the two views which they
offer the most commonly adopted is that
it refers to the class of gladiators who
bore that name from appearing in Sam-
nite arms (Liv. 9. 40, Cic. Tuse. D. 2. 17.
41, de Or. 2. 8. 325, pro Sest. 64. 134).
They were ordinarily matehed <see the
last reference) with a ‘provocator.‘ If
this is so, the meaning seems to be that
the two critics‚ though pretending to
sight, were as a pair of gladiators both
of whom are armed for defence rather
than offence. The other view is that
Horace had in view some lines of Ennius
with respect to the stubborn resistanee of
the Samnites to Rome. The Scholiasts
quote a line‘ Bellum aequis· manibus
nox intempesta diremit) ‘The poets
fight [though in their case it is a sham
fight] as the Samnites in Ennius till the
lights of evening.'

battle; ‘ discessit victor’ Epp. 1. 10. 37.

myself 1 am obliged to submit to this
sort of thing, but now I have done with
it let me keep quite clear of it)

that poets are mad, Epp. 2. 1. 118.
