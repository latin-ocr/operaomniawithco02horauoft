 

LIB. I.

SAT. 4. 55

Nulla taberna meos habeat neque pila libellos,
Quis manus insudet vulgi Hermogenisque Tigelli.
Nec recito cuiquam nisi amicis, idque coactus,

Non ubivis coramve quibuslibet.
Scripta foro recitent sunt multi quique lavantes:
Suave locus voci resonat conclusus.

In medio qui

Hoc iuvat, haud illud quaerentes, num sine sensu,

Tempore num faciant alieno.
Inquit, ‘et hoc studio pravus
Hoc in me iacis?

Vixi cum quibus? Absentem

me’? ‘If you had clean hands you
might laugh at the insormers, but sup-
posing that you are like Caelius, while I
am not like Caprius, why should you
sear me'? The mutual opposition of
the two clauses under ‘ut’ is expressed
by the emphatic ‘tu sis‚’ ‘ non ego si1n,'
‘you are, 1 am not.' ‘ Habeat ¹ is
potential. We are still feeling the hypo-
thetieal construction of ‘ut sis,' etc.
‘It does not follow that my writing
should lie in any bookseller’s shop.’ To
make it optative renders the transition
to ‘ nec recito’ impossible, as Bentley
felt. You can pass from a modified
statement to an unmodified one, but a
wish and a fact cannot be connected by
‘ nec.'

71. taberna . . . pila: cp. A. P. 374;
variously explained of a pillar erected
opposite a shop and of shops under
arcades, such as are common in Italian
towns now (see Burn's Rome and The
Campagna, p. 90). The pillar opposite
the shop would be used both as a support
for an additional stall for exposing the
wares, ⁴ armaria quae apud pilas sunt '
Porph., and sor hanging advertisements
and specimens: cp. Mart. 1.1 18.10‘C0n-
tra Caesaris est forum taberna Scriptis
postibus hinc et inde totis Omnes ut cito
perlegas poetas,’ ib. 7. 61. 5 ‘nulla
catenatis pila est praecincta lagenis.'

129, 1. 9. 25, 1. 10. 18, 80, 903 see
Introd. to Sat. 1. 3. He is the represent—
ative of the foppish and effeminate taste
of the day in music and poetty. So
that Horace says ‘1 do not mean to
court popularity either with the crowd
or with the would-be cn'tics whose taste
Ι value no higher.'

73. recito: absol. as in Juv. S. 3. Q

authority.

75. lavantes, as Mai-nal, 3. 44. 12, of
the egotistical poet, ‘ in thermas fugio:
sonas ad aurem.'

76. suave, etc„ an ironical excuse,
imagined for them. ‘ It is such a good
room for sound.’ The edd. compare
Sen. Epist. 56 speaking of the noise en-
dured by one who lodges near a bath;
⁴ adice illum eui vox sua in balneoplacet.'

inanes, ‘ frivolous‚' a Lucretian use, 1.
659 etc. This is the comment on the
excuse.

77. sensu ι cp. the use of ‘sensus com-
munis ' Sat. 1. 3. 66.

79. inquit, sc. ‘aliquis,' of an
imagined answer, even when the passage is
generally in the second person; so Sat.
2. 2. 99. It is a prose usage. Bentley
quotes Cic. pro Clu. 34. 92 and pro Flacc.
2 3. 55.

studio, with facis ; ‘ with zeal.' As
Cicero ‘ studio accusare’ Rosc. Am. 32.
91.

pravus : as we say ‘ from a crook in
your nature.’ So Sat. 2. 7. 71 ‘ quae belua
ruptis Cum semel effugit reddit se prava
eatenis.’

80. quis, ‘ aliquis‚' as Sat. 1. 3. 63.

denique: the same use as in an or—
dinary climax, though, as not unsre-
quently‚ there are only two steps in the
ascent. Cp. EppLz. 127,

81—103. Horace first gives a picture
of the malignity of disposition. Then,
in the light of this, he contrasts with
his own comments on his neighbours,
first the readily-eoneeded licence os
the jester at the banquet, then the in-
uendoes of a ‘ candid friend.'
