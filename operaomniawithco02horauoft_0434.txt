HORATII ARS POETICA.

Qui purgor bilem sub verni temporis horam!

Non alius faceret meliora poemata.
Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum

Reddere quae ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi;

Nil tanti est.

Verum

305

Munus et officium nil scribens ipse docebo,
Unde parentur opes, quid alat formetque poetam;

Quid deceat, quid non;

quo virtus, quo ferat error.

Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons:

Rem tibi Socraticae poterunt ostendere chartae,

310

Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Qui didicit patriae quid debeat et quid amicis,

Quo sit amore parens, quo frater amandus et hospes,
Quod sit conscripti, quod iudicis officium, quae

Partes in bellum missi ducis, ille profecto

3¹5

Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique.
Respicere exemplar vitae morumque iubebo
Doctum imitatorem et vivas hinc ducere voces.

The playfulness here has the purpose of
softening the transition to the most
directly didactic part of the poem.

303. verni temporis. This was ac-
cording to the prescription ofthe faculty:
see Celsus 2. 13, of white hellebore,
‘ neque hieme neque aestate recte datur3
optime vere, tolerabiliter autumno.’

304. nil tanti est, ‘it is nothing of
importance.⁷ This is the meaning in
Cic. ad Att. 2. 13 ‘iuratus tibi possum
dicere nihil esse tanti.'

cotis: according to Plutarch this
trope had been used by Isocrates when
he was asked why he taught speaking
instead of speaking himself, καῖ αἱ &novat
αὐταὶ μὲν τεμεῖν οὐ δύνανται, τὸν δὲ
σίδηρον ὀξέα καῖ τμητικὸν ποιοῦσι.

307. opes, ‘ his resourceS.'

309. Contrast Epp. 2. 2. 141. These
lines seem to give a keynote to the Ars
Poetica. It is the reconciliation of the
breach, if it was ever a serious one,
between Horace's literary and philo-
sophical inclinations. He has learnt
something as he proposed (Epp. Ι. 1.
11) of ‘ quid deceat, quid non‚’ etc„ but
a poet's digestion turns all matter to
poetic use, and his studies at least bear
fruit in ‘ ope5‚ alimenta, insormatio‚' for
other aspirants to poesy. Notice also
that this line is the serious answer to

the suggestion, playfully discussed, of
Democritus. ‘ Sound poetry' (‘ scribendi
reete,’ cp. Sat. 1. 4. 13 ‘ scribendi reete,
nam ut multum nil moror ³), so far from
being the product of a erazed brain, has
behind it Sound thinking, the trained
intelligence of the philosopher, at second
hand from the study of books (v. 310),
and at first hand from the study of lise
(v. 3¹7)-

310. rem: as the next line shows, op-
posed to ‘ verba ' ; ‘ lnatter‚' ‘ substance)
Cic. de Or. 3. 31. 125 ‘ rerum copia ver-
borum copiam gignit.'

Socraticae chartae. An expression
from Lucilius 27. 46 ‘ubi nunc Socratici
charti ἲ ’ see on Od. 1. 29. 14 ‘Socra-
ticam domum.⁷ Horace describes him-
self as taking Plato with him when he
goes into the country; Sat. 2. 3. 11
‘ stipare Platona Menandro!

31 2—316. From moral philosophy we
gather ideals of men in various relations
which we may impersonate in our char-
acters for the stage.

314. conscripti. Cicero uses ⁶ Pater
conscriptus’ for a single senator, Phil.
13. 13. 28 ; but this is the only instance
of ‘ conscriptus' alone for a senator.

318. doctum : as Orelli, ‘ qui arti
satisfaciat’; one who is to pass as a poet
who has learnt his business.
