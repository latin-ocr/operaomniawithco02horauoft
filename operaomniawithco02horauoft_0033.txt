LIB. I.

SAT. 1. 21

Audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem 30
Sese ferre, senes ut in otia tuta recedant,

Aiunt, curn sibi sint congesta cibaria: sicut

Parvula, nam exemplo est, magni formica laboris

Ore trahit quodcunque potest atque addit acervo,

Quem struit haud ignara ac non incauta futuri. 35
Quae, simul inversum contristat Aquarius annum,

Non usquam prorepit et illis utitur ante

Quaesitis sapiens; cum te neque fervidus aestus

30. currunt, of sailing, as Virgil's
‘vastum trabe currimus aequor.’ So
Od. 1. 28. 363 Epp. 1. 1. 45, 1. 11.
2 .

7hae mente: Sat. 2. 2. 90.

32. aiunt. The position of the verb
seems to imply that these are their own
expressions.

cibaria, used gen. of a soldier⁷s
rations or the allowances in kind of
other public servants, and so the mean-
ing here is ‘enough for a bare and
measured maintenance’3 congesta, as
Palm. points out, introduces the simili-
tude.

33. exemplo, the model, the stock
example, as in the Book of Proverbs
6. 6-8, 30. 25, and Virg. G. 1. 186
‘inopi metuens formica senectae '; Aen.
4. 402 ‘ formicae . . . hiemis memores?

parvula . . . magni laboris recalls
the antithesis which pervades the fourth
Georgic‚ ‘ingentes animos angusto in
pectore versant.’

36. quae. As the editors say=‘at
ea'3 cp. ‘quod si comminuas' v. 43.
The adversative force is of course in the
thought, not in the Pronoun. It is a
reply. What the relative does is to
make us feel the identity of the subject
in the two statements. Horace takes
the money-getters on their own ground.
They appeal to the example of the ant.
This very ant condemns them. There
is the same force (whatever be the case
or construction of ‘ quod') in the ordi-
nary use of ‘ quod si,’ ‘ whereas if,’ ‘yes,
but if': it puts the new conditional
statement and the original statement at
the same starting-point.

inversum annum. Summer and
winter are represented like night and
day (Virg. Aen. 2. 250 ‘vertitur interea
caelum ') as two hemispheres which suc-
ceed each other. In the winter the
lower one has come to the top.

contristat Aquarius. Virg. G. 3.
279 ‘pluvio contristat frigore caelum ';
ib. 304 ‘cum frigidus olim Iam cadit
extremoque irrorat Aquarius anno.’ The
sun entered the sign of Aquarius on
an. 16.

J 37. usquam, with a verb of motion,
as we say ‘where' for ‘whither.’ Cp.
Sat. 2. 7. 30, Epp. 1. 7. 25.

et, after a negative clause; see on
Od. 1. 27.16 and Epod. 15. 14.

illis, those of which you were speak-
m .

{S sapiens. So I have printed with
Orelli, Ritter, Dillr„ and Munro. Keller
gives ⁴ patiens) The balance ofexternal
evidence is nearly even. B. has ‘ patiens,‘
which the pseudo-Acron read ‘patiens
atque contenta.y Cruquius gives ‘sapiens’
as the reading of all his MSS„ and the
Comm. Cruq. interpreted it ‘prudens,
provida.' The schol. of Porph. is so
much mutilated as to be valueless in
evidence. Keller points out that the
same confusion infests the MSS. in Epp.
1. 7. 40. ‘ Sapiens' is more in Horace’s
style, summing up his view of the
ant's conduct in the last word, before
he proceeds to contrast with it that
of her professed imitator; ‘patiens,'
although Sat. 2. 6. 91 ς( praerupti ne-
moris patientem vivere dorso') and
Epp. 1. 17. 13 (‘si pranderet olus
patienter') show that it might well
stand for ‘contenta,' would not be as
pointed.

fervidus aestus . . . hiems. The
expression is at first taken from the case
of the ant, ‘ she rests in winter, you rest
never': in ignis, mare, ferrum it is
proverbial. See Od. 1. 16. 10, Epp.
1. 1. 46. Orelli quotes Eupolis (Frag.
Corn. ed. Meinek. 2. p. 487) οὐ nvp
οὐδὲ σίδηρος οὐδὲ χαλκὸς ἀπείργει μὴ
φοιτᾶν ἐπὶ δεῖπνον.
