326 HORATII EPISTULARUM LIB. Ι.

Lepidus was elected after a contest), but
as ἔλαχε might be ε ‘ It was his fortune
to have Lepidus as a colleague.' Orelli
prefers the simpler explanation that it
is used as ‘ comitem ducere ³ of the one
who was consul first. Keller holds that
‘ (luxit ⁷ is an early error for ⁴ dixit,'
which is the technieal phrase used gas
in Liv. 7. 24) when a sole consul
nominates a colleague. But apart from
the fact that Horace usually avoids
rather than afsects exact technical terms‚

EPIST. 20.

the verb does not suit the election of
Lepidus as Dion describes it.

The Lollius of this verse cannot be
the Lollius of Epistles 2 and 18, who
in Β. C. 20 was still a young man, but is
usually taken to be his father. He is
also the friend whom Horace so warmly
upholds in Od. 4. 9. The two Epistles,
then, are due probably to Horace's
friendship for the father, and the book
ends fitly with the name which is by it
to be linked with the poet’s immortality.
