HORATII ARS POETICA.

Nec facundia deseret hunc nec lucidus ordo.

Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor,

Ut iam nunc dicat iam nunc debentia dici,

Pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat3

Hoc amet, hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor. 45
In verbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis,

Dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum

Reddiderit iunctura novum.

fectively.' So Quintil. 12. 10. 72 ‘dicit
utiliter et ad id quod intendit potenter.'
Possibly Horace means it so here, ‘ chosen
effectively‚' the emphasis being on‘ lecta,’
not on ‘ potenter‚' and the choice of the
adv. in this place having a paradoxical
force; ‘ the place where you must look
to make your poem effective is not,
where you think, in the composition,
but in the choice of subject.' The Scho-
liasts explain it by ‘ qui legerit id quod
praestare possit‚' ⁴ secundum quod po-
test,' i. e. ¹ in accordance with his powers.²
Porphyrion's special note is ⁴ Potenter,
figuravit (1.6. ‘he has given a parti-
cular colour to the word ') ὡς εἶ’ δυνατός,“
and this has been followed by most
editors. It makes excellent sense. The
drawback is the want of a parallel sor
the use in Latin and of any Greek
phrase of which it would seem to be an
exact translation. Prof. Wilkins pro-
poses to make it the opposite of ‘im-
potenter' and equivalent to ἐγκρατῶς,
⁴ with sels-restraint?

41. facundia: cp. v. 311.

ordo. This is the link word between
the precept of vv. 58-40 and what has
preceded. The lack of unity, ‘purple
patches,' exaggeration of detail, etc.. are
failings in order, and the first condition
to attaining either· something to say or
the power to order what you say, is to
choose a subject within your capacity.
Order is defined in vv. 42-45‚ and in
words which have this retrospective
bearing. Then in v. 46 Horace proceeds
to his next point, that order has its
sphere in respect to diction as well as
matter.

42. ordinis. The repetition is em-
phatic; see last note.

venus: v. 3²0 ‘Fabula nullius ve-
neris ’3 ‘ charm.‘

aut ego fallor: as ‘nisi fallor' in
Virg. Aen. 5. 49, etc.‚ ‘or’ or ‘unless
(which is impossible) I am mistaken.’

Si sorte necesse est

Some good MSS. (as B) have ‘haud,'
but apparently by a mistake.

43. iam nunc . . . iam nunc, ‘ says
at this moment what needs at this mo-
ment to be said.⁷

44. pleraque. His ‘facundia' sug-
gests to him a number of things to say;
'ordo’ requires that ‘most of them'
should wait for their fitting time of ut-
terance.

45. The words hoc amet, hoe sper-
nar, are a repetition of the precept of
the last two lines, but justified by the
stronger colour of the words, ‘ love—-
despise.’ The author of a poem which
is to fulfil his promises must have one
canon of taste for judging what he
writes ε ‘ Does it suit the place ’θ’ if so,
it is admirable: if not, however beau-
tiful in itself, it is here contemptible.

promissi t Epod. 14. 7. It is in
effect equivalent to ‘inceptis . . . magna
professis‚’ above v. 14.

bentley transposed vv. 45 and 46, and
he is followed by many editors, including
Dillr„ Munro, and Schiitz. Keller in his
Epilegomena‚ though allowing that ‘ the
Archetype’ had the order of the Vulg.,
gives his assent to Bentley's change.
There is no hint of disturbance in the
MSS. as there is in Epp. 1. 1. 57, 58.
The Scholiasts evidently had our present
text. Nor is the change necessary. On
the other hand we lose by separating
⁴ serendis ’ from ‘ iunctura.’ The special
point of order in relation to diction
which is touched is the power of arrange-
ment to gain all the force of novelty
without its risks.

46. etiam, as well as in matter.

tenuis cautusque. The epithets
touch two points, fineness of sense (see
sor use of ‘ tenuis'= ‘ subtilis ' on Od. 2.
16. 38) and sobriety ofjudgment.

bining.'
