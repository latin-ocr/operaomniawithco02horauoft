HORATII SATIRARUM

120

There is a medium between looking after things too sharply and not looking
after them at all.

‘fo—81. Now hear the advantages of plain living. First, it means good digestim,
and with good digestion comes a free and active mind.

82-98. Next, it leaves a margin for improvement; for holidays or when health
requires it. Luxury has used up all its resources.

89—99. In the good old days delicacies were always reserved for hospitality.
Gluttony leads even now to disgrace as well as to ruinous extravagance.

99-111. Do you answer that there is no fear of ruin in your case; that you have
enough to spend on your gluttony? I answer that there are better uses of
money. Relieve the poor, restore temples, give to your country. But have
you immunity from human chanees'? And if change come, who is best fitted
to meet it, the man who is accustomed to plain living or the man of luxury? ⁷

112-136. Ofellus practised what he taught. I knew him when Ι was a boy as a
proprietor where now he pays rent and works hard. He lived plainly then,
and when reverses came he applied his philosophy to his own case and taught
his sons to do the same.

The lecture (verses 1-111) 15 pretty clearly meant to be put into the mouth of
Ofellus, who is described as an old neighbour of Horace's, and as a representative
of the sturdy independence and strong sense of his fellow countrymen the ‘pernix
Apulus' (Epod. 2. 41), ‘Sabellus’ (Sat. 2. 1. 36; Epp. 1. 16. 49), etc. The
purpose of the lecture suits the character, but, as in those of Stertinius in Sat.
2. 3 and Davus in Sat. 2. 7, there is little or no attempt to make the style or
topics in detail correspond to the speaker. It is a Satire‚ such as in the First
Book would have been in Horace’s own mouth, on the luxury and caprices of
the day.

It will be noticed (see on v. 114) that Ofellus is supposed to have been dis-
possessed of his property at the same time as Horace himself, viz. in B.C. 41,
and to have lived on as a tenant under Umbrenus (v. 133), the veteran to whom
the land had been assigned. Xl‘hether he is supposed to be alive still does not
appear.

It is one of the Satires in which Horace seems to have taken the topic and
general idea of treatment from Lucilius, who, according to Cicero, de Fin. 2.
8. 24, put a lecture against greediness into the mouth of Laelius. One of the
fragments of it quoted by Cicero is referred to in v. 46 3 see note there.

QUAE virtus et quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo
(Nec meus hic sermo est, sed quae praecepit Ofellus
Rusticus, abnormis sapiens, crassaque Minerva,)

1. boni, ‘good sirs.’ Ofellus' ad-
dress to some imagined audience of but the mistake is easy (there isasimilar
neighboum, rather than Horace's own, mistake the other way in some MSS. in
in which case it would be unlike his verse 1, ⁴ bonis sit⁷ for ‘ boni sit ’), and
usual style. For its use in the sing. the reference which Lambinus first sug-
see on Sat. 2. 3. 31. gested to Cic. de Am. 5. 18 ‘Nunquam

vivere parvo: Od. 2. 16. 13. ego dicam C. Fabricium, Μ’. Curium

2. nee meus : a Greek form, οὐ ’γὰρ quos sapientes nostri maiores iudicabant

though of no school.' V. had ‘ abnormi,’

ἐμὸς ὁ μῦθος ἀλλὰ Φαίδρου τοῦδε ὃν
μέλλω λέγειν Plat. Sympos. p. 177.
3. abnormis sapiens, ‘ a philosopher

ad istorum normam fuisse sapientes,'has
a fuller bearing than he noticed, for not
only is Cicero speaking in the same
