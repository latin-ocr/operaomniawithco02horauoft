HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ire viam qua monstret eques; venaticus, ex quo * 65
Tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,

Militat in silvis catulus,

Nunc adbibe puro

Pectore verba puer, nunc te melioribus offer.
Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem

Testa diu.

Quodsi cessas aut strenuus anteis, 70

Nec tardum opperior nec praecedentibus insto.

lem,' ‘while he learns the lesson easily
because his neck is tender.'

65. ire feels the constr. both of ‘ fin-
git ’=‘docet’ and of ‘ docilem.'

’ venaticus: pred. ‘The bound who
does service in the forest has been a
hunter from the day when he barked at
a stuffed stag's hide in the yard.'

67. puro pectore: perh.=while the
beart is still a καθαρὰς πίναξ.

68. puer, ‘in boyhood.’ Isthe word
is meant to characterize Lollius cp.
Epp. 1. 18. 55 ‘puer . . . Cantabrica
bella tulisti? That would be two or
three years previously. But possibly, as
so osten in the Epistles, it is an
imaginary auditor rather than Lollius
whom Horace is addressing.

melioribus: see Epp. 1. 1. 48
‘ meliori credere.'

69. See note on Od. 1. 20. 2, Quin-
tilian 1. 1. 5 (putting together in mean-
ing this line and Od. 3. 5. 27) ‘ natura
tenacissimi sumus eorum quae rudibus
annis percepimus, ut sapor quo nova
imbuas durat, nec lanarum colores qui-
bus simplex ille candor mutatus est elui
possunt.’

70-71. The point of this seems to be
the ironical assurance that his preaehing
is not too earnest. ‘You must take
what I have said or leave it. If you
try to throw me off I shall make no
efforts to keep pace with you.' Cp„
for the figure, Sat. 1. 9. 9, of one
trying to get rid of a companion, ‘Ire
modo ocius, interdum consistere‚' etc.;
and for the use of ‘praecedere’ id.
v. 42.
