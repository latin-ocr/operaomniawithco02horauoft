Labra movet metuens audiri:

HORATII EPISTULARUM

⁶ Pulchra Laverna‚ 60

Da mihi fallere, da iusto sanctoque videri,
Noctem peccatis et fraudibus obice nubem.’
Qui melior servo, qui liberior sit avarus,
In triviis fixum cum se demittit ob assem,

Non vide03 nam qui cupiet metuet quoque3

porro, 6 5

Qui metuens vivet, liber mihi non erit unquam.

Perdidit arma, locum virtutis deseruit, qui

Semper in augenda festinat et obruitur re.

Vendere cum possis captivum occidere noli;

Serviet utiliter: sine pascat durus aretque, 70
Naviget ac mediis hiemet mercator in undis3

Annonae prosit3 portet frumenta penusque.

Vir bonus et sapiens audebit dicere: ‘Pentheu,

60. Laverna: the goddess of thieves
and impostors.

61. iusto sanctoque videri, restored
to the text by Bentley for ‘ iustum sanc-
tumque,' found in many MSS. V had
the dative. For the constr. cp. Sat. 1. 1.
19, Madv. ξ 393.

63 sou. The connection is through
the motive suggested for the secret
wrong—doing in vv. 60-62, ‘Laverna,‘
‘ fraudibus? ‘ This man a “ vir bonus'‘ l
why he is a slave to the vulgarest of
desires and fears.'

64. Imitated by Persius 5. 111 ‘Inque
luto fixum possis transcendere nummum.'
The Scholiast there explains that it was
a trick of Roman boys to fasten a eoin
to the pavement in order to see who
would stoop to pick it up. 1f this is
doubted we must take fixum in the
sense of ‘sticking' i. e. in the mud,
which is more possible with ‘in luto'
than with ‘ in triviis?

65. qui cupiet metuet quoque.
Cp. Epp. Ι. 6. 9. foll.; also Epp. 1.
2. 51, 2. 2. 156. We are handling here
commonplaees of Stoic teaching.

66. mihi, ‘in my judgment.'

67. perdidit arma. He is a ῥίψα-
σπίς.

locum virtutis deseruit. The gen.
gives the matter of the allegory. He
was a soldier in virtue's army; but not
(as the true ‘vir bonus ⁷) a good soldier,
but one who deserted his post. ‘ Locum '
as Virgil's ‘loca iussa tenere ' Aen. 10.
238. Orelli quotes Dem.Olynth. 3.§ 36

παραχωρεῖν . . . τῆς τάξεως . . . τῆς
ἀρετῆς.

68. obruitur: a Ciceronian figure
‘obruimur ambitione et foro’ de Or.
1. 21. 94, ‘obrui tanquam fluctu in
magnitudine negotii ' ad Qu. Fr. 1.
1. 3. For in re augenda cp. Epp.
Ι· 69—7713. Horace, following up the
figure of the runaway soldier, apo-
strophizes his imagined captor. ‘He is
a born slave—keep him—set him to
shepherd or to plough, or do your bid-
ding on the sea.' In plain language,
‘ of such stuff are made not “ viri boni ’⁹
or philosophers, but those who pursue
the menial and money-making profes—
sions.' The ‘ mereator‚’ as usual, is the
type of eager pursuit of wealth; see
especially Od. 3. 24. 40 n. and Epp. 1.
1. 45 foll. Note the philosophical con-
tempt for industrial life.

70. durus. Cp. Epp. Ι. 7. 91. It
answers in its own clause to ‘mediis
hiemet in undis ’ in the next—‘ the man
will shrink from no toil.’

72. annonae prosit, ‘ help to cheapen
corn' by taking part in its importation.
It is a contemptuous allowance that the
trader is of some benefit to the com-
munity.

penus: defined by Cic. de N. D. 2.
27. 68 ‘est enim omne quo vescuntur
homines penus.' Horace’s use of the
word as a neuter is noticed by Priscian.
Virgil makes it masc. in Aen. 1. 703.

73. vir bonus et sapiens. We
