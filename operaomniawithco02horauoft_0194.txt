HORATII SATIRARUM

Roscius orabat sibi adesses ad Puteal cras.’ 35
‘De re communi scribae magna atque nova te

Orabant hodie meminisses, Quinte, reverti.'

‘Imprimat his, cura, Maecenas signa ‘tabellis’

Dixeris, ⁵ Experiar : ³

‘Si vis, potes,’ addit et instat.

Septimus octavo propior iam fugerit annus 40
Ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere suorum

In numero ;

dumtaxat ad hoc, quem tollere rheda

Vellet iter faciens et cui concredere nugas

Hoc genus :

tense os ‘ orabat,’ ⁶ orabant‚’ is the epis-
tolary imperfect (Madv. ξ 345) used
also in mess-ages, as Ter. Eun. 3. 3. 26
‘ Thais maxumo te orabat opere ut cras
redires?

ante secundam . . . adesses ad Pu-
teal. Cp. the parallel quoted from
Cic. pro Quintio 6. 25 ‘ necessarios . . .
corrogat ut ad tabulam Sestiam sibi
adsint hora secunda postridie.⁷ ‘ Tabula
Sestia ⁷ is not mentioned elsewhere,
though‘ tabula Valeria ' occurs in similar
connections in Cic. pro Vatin. 9. 21 and
ad Fam. 14. 2. They are variously ex-
plained as bankers’ counters where
money would be paid or accounts veri-
fied, and as the localities of courts for
the settlement of money questions. A
similar doubt, as old as the Scholiasts,
besets the meaning of ‘' puteal ' ; ‘ locus
Romae ad quem veniebant feneratores3
alii dicunt : in quo tribunal solebat esse
Praetoris⁷ Acr. It cannot therefore be
certainly determined whether Horace's
unknown friend Roscius has asked his
countenance in court (for ‘ adesset' in
this sense cp. Sat. 1. 9. 38) or his pre-
sence or guarantee at a banker’s. On
‘ puteal ³ see further on Epp. 1. 19. 8.

36. re communi. The ‘scribae,’
clerks in public offices, were organized
in ‘decuriae' Cicero calls them collec-
tively ⁴ ordo' in Verr. Act. 2. 3. 79. 183
Horace had held a clerkship in the
quaestor’s office. ‘ Communi' naturally
means ‘ common to them and you'3 but
this would not necessarily imply that
Horace was still engaged as a ‘ scriba?
His interest in these affairs would still
be taken for granted by the ‘ scribae,'
though from his own point of view
he classes them amongst ‘aliena ne-
gotia)

‘Hora quota est? Thrax est Gallina Syro par?

37. Quinte. Orelli bases on this
use of the ‘ praenomen ' his chief argu—
ment for these being soliloquies. He
thinks a messenger would not have been
so familiar ; but perhaps this is answered
by Ritter; the scribes address Horace
as an old colleague; the message may
well be brought by one of the order.
This is the only place where Horace’s
‘praenomen ' is named in his writings.

reverti : to come back from the Es⁴
quiline to the Forum.

38. imprimat signa. It is a highly
probable inference from these words
that Maecenas was at the time of the
writing of the Satire in the position
described in Dion 51. 3, having charge
of affairs at home during Augustus‘
absence from Italy, and bearing his
signet ring3 see Introd. to the Satires,

39 dixeris, the subj of supposi-
tion, the second person generalizing, as
though Horace’s experience were not
peculiar; ‘if one says.

40. septimus octavo propior iam
fugerit, ‘the seventh year, already
nearing the eighth, will soon be gone‚'
i.e. it is now seven, or more nearly
eight years since, etc. For the bearing
and difficulties of this line see Introd. to
the Satires, p. 3.

42. dumtaxat ad hoo, ‘at least to
this extent‚’ the extent defined by the
relative clause ‘ quem tollere vellet,' etc.

44. hoe genus Madv. ξ 237, c.
obs. 3.

Thrax: Epp. 1. 18. 36: a gla-
diator armed with Thracian buckler and
short sword. A ‘ Thrax’ was usually
coupled with a ‘mirmillo.' Gallina,
a nickname‚ perhaps of a Gaul, and
Syrus are proper names,
