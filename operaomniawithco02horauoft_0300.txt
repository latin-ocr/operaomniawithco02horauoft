HORATII EPISTULARUM

Quicquid erat nactus praedae maioris ubi omne
Verterat in fumum et cinerem, ‘Non hercule mir01·,’

Aiebat, ‘si qui comedunt bona, curn sit obeso

Nil melius turdo, nil volva pulchrius ampla.’
Nimirum hic ego sum,· nam tuta et parvula laudo
Cum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis3

Verum ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem

Vos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum

Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.

a character in Lucilius. If we keep
‘ correctus’ it may mean either ‘like a
reformed Bestius: Bestius being supposed
to he a glutton or spendthrift who
changed his tone, or ‘ a very Bestius now
that he is reformed‚⁷ Bestius being as
Acr. suggested a man of stern fruga—
lity. If we accept ‘corrector’ it will
mean ‘ a very Bestius in his zeal for re-
form ⁷ ; but we have still to supply from
our imagination‚ what there is no evi-
dence of, that Bestius was a preacher of
good morals in actual life or in some
Satire or play. Bentley shows that
⁴ corrector’ was a common term, and
was used both with a gen. as in Epp. 2.
1. 129, and absol. as in Ter. Adelph. 4.
7. 24, but we cannot say that ζ correctus’
or ‘ correptus’ (cp. Sat. 2. 3. 257 of just
such a reformed character ‘correptus
voce magistri ³) is impossible. Persius' use
of the name 6. 37 ‘ Bestius urguet Doct-
ores Glgtios'l apparently for a general
censor would suit the reading ‘correc-
tor ' very well, but the language which
is likened to that of Bestius is censorious
enough to explain the reference without
his being actually called ‘ corrector.’

38. quicquid : here equivalent to ‘ si

q 39. in fumum: the words must be
metaphoricah ⁴ any plunder he got was
treated as the plunder of a captured
city.' Nothing was kept, everything
devastated3 cp. the metaphor of v. 31.
Such metaphors are not very clearly
realized, and there may be a half con-
seious suggestion of the kitchen altar on
which his gains were consumed.

40. comedunt, ‘put down their
throats? Cic. has the word with the
same mixture of literal and metaphori-
cal meaning, ‘ utrum ego tibi patrimo-
nium eripui, Gelli, an tu comedistiP'

obeso turdo. A fieldfare is the
titbit to be sent to the rich man by the
legacy-hunter‚ Sat. 2. 5. 10. Cp. the
‘ macros turdos ⁷ of Sat. 1. 5. 72.

melius . . . pulchrius z words which
in his short-lived reformation he learnt
to use of moral excellencies: sor ‘pul-
cher’ in that sense see Epp. 1. 2. 3 and
30.

42. nimirum: the particle empha-
sizes the explanation of this long para-
ble, but, as often, it has in it a suggestion
of irony.

Orelli points out‘· is widened beyond

‘impransi mecum disquirite⁷ with the

on Ep. 1.14.21‚ and cp. Epp. 1.17.12.

but with a half literal sense given to it
by its conjunction with ‘ villis‚’ ‘with a
solid foundation in trim country houses.’
It seems clear that there is an implied
contrast between the smartness of Vala's
country house in south Italy and the
roughness of the poet’s own humble
quarters in the Sabine valley.
