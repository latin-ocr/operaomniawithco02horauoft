276 HORATII EPISTULARUM

implies that he had a ‘ pater' and was therefore ‘ ingenuus? Others have thought
of him as one of Horace’s neighbours, employed by him to carry his parcel from
his country house to Rome. Is the Emperor however to be supposed to be in
Rome? Isso, it has been suggested that the Sosii (Epp. 1. 20. 2) who would
have prepared the copy, would be the more natural agents in its delivery; also
that the imagery of a journey ‘ per clivos, fiumina, 1amas‚’ even if it be in part
at least metaphoricaL seems less appropriate to such a short and well-beaten road
as that from Tibur to Rome. If ‘the Emperor was abroad, as we know him to
have been from B.C. 22 to 19, Vinius may have been anyone in Rome who was
going to Sicily, Samos, or some other place where the Court at the moment was.

(2) The nature of the ‘carmina’ of v. 17. What was Horace sending or
professing to send? The usual answer has been, the-first three booles oftlze Odes;
and there is much probability to be alleged for it, in respect of the importance of
the occasion supposed, of Horace’s usual employment of the term ‘carmina ' when
applied to his own writings ³⁵, of the plural ‘libellis ’ v. 4 (contrast ‘ libello ’ of the
first book of Satires, Sat. 1. 10. 92), ‘fasciculum librorum’ v. 13, and generally of
the date to which the Epistle is then referred. If, however, any more particular
date is sought, difficulties arise. The Odes, we have every reason to believe, were
given to the world in B.C. 23. Augustus did not leave Rome for Sicily and the
East before the middle of Β. C. 22. Are we to imagine, then, that Horace's Odes
were unknown to him for some months after their publication? or are we to look
upon this as a formal presentation of a book which the poet already knew to be
approved of? Must we fall back on the theory osa mission from the Sabine villa
to Rome? or should we remember how fragmentary is our knowledge of the
Emperor's movemeuts, whether in Italy or outside of it?

²³* ‘ Carmina* is Horace’s word for his Odes when contrasted with the ¹ lambi’ and ⁴ Sermones,’
Epp. 2. 2. 59; cp. Epp. 2. 1. 250. 258. At the same time ‘carmen’ is used (Sat. 1. 10. 66 and 75,
2. 1. 63) of Lucilius' Satires, and therefore might presumably be used of Horace's own. Its use
in Sat. 2. 6. 22 is part of the moek-heroic language adopted for the moment.
