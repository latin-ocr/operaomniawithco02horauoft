366 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Perdiderat3 post hoc vehemens lupus, et sibi et hosti
Iratus pariter, ieiunis dentibus acer,

Praesidium regale loco deiecit, ut aiunt, 30
Summe munito et multarum divite rerum.

Clarus ob id factum donis ornatur honestis,

Accipit et bis dena super sestertia nummum.

Forte sub hoc tempus castellum evertere praetor

Nescio quod cupiens hortari coepit eundem 35
Verbis quae timido quoque possent addere mentem:
‘ I, bone, quo virtus tua te vocat, i pede fausto,
Grandia laturus meritorum praemia. Quid stas?'
Post haec ille catus, quantumvis rusticus: ‘Ibit‚
Ibit eo quo vis qui zonam perdidit‚' inquit.

Romae nutriri mihi contigit, atque doceri

Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.

‘My life was running on other lines.
I had the education of a man of means,
at Rome and Athens, and was started
in the tastes that really suited me, of
philosophy. This was broken off by
the civil war, which made me a soldier
and then a beggar. It was poverty that
made me write verses, But that motive
is now removed.'
