2368 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus?
Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes; 55
Eripuere iocos, Venerem, convivia, ludum3

Tendunt extorquere poemata

quid faciam vis?

Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque:

Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis,

Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro. 60
Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur.

Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.

Quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu, quod iubet alter;
Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus.
Praeter cetera me Romaene poemata censes 65

‘ calido sub pectore mascula bilis Intum-
uit quod non extinxerit urna cicutae)
Cp. A. Ρ. 301 ‘O ego laevus, Qui purgor
bilem sub verni temporis horam. Non
alius faceret meliora poemata.'

54. melius dormire . . . quam sori—
bere. For the alternative cp. Sat. 2.
1. 7.

55. An abrupt passage to another
ground for not eomposing. With the
thought cp. Virg. E. 9. 51, where excuse
is being given for not singing ‘omnia
fert aetas, animum quoque.'

57. tendunt extorquere ε the power
is not gone yet, but it is the next thing
to go. For the inf. see vol. 1. App. 2.

qm‘d faciam vis z ‘ what would you
have me do ’.Γ i. e. ‘it is a natural pro-
cess. How do you think Ι ean resist
it ‚⁹

58. denique : ‘ and if there was any-
thing to do there is this remaining diffi-
culty, that you can⁷t agree what kind
os poetry you wish from me. ‘ Denique '
finishes the series so sar, though other
reasons follow in v. 65 foll. ; cp. Lucret.
1. 301, and see on Sat. 1. 1. 92.

59. carmine: see on v. 25.

iambis. Horace’s own name for his
Epodes: see on Epod. 14. 7, and ep.
Epp. 1. 19. 23, also Od. 1. 16. 2.

60. Bioneis sermonibus. As the
epithet implies, this means the Satires
(cp. Epp. 1. 4. 1). The Epistles are lost
to sight, as though ex hypothesi they
were no satisfaction os Florus' desire.
Bion Borysthenites, a Scythian by birth,
was a philosopher and wit at Athens in
the third century Β. C. He was a Cynie
at one time, a Cyrenaic at another, and
lastly a pupil of Theophrastus the Peri-

patetic. Horace is concerned with
him not as a philosopher but as the re-
puted author of many pungent sayings,
some of which are preserved by Diog.
Laert. 4. 46. Cp. Cic. Tusc. D. 3. 26. 62.

sale nigro z literally, in Sat. 2. 4. 74,
of a strong and coarse salt, here meta-
phorical of coarse and biting wit. Cp.
the use of ‘niger' iu Sat. 1. 4. 85, 91.
As he looks back at them Horace clearly
shows that he prefers the ‘Attic salt ’
of his Epistles to the coarser strain of
his earlier Satires.

61, 62. A metaphorical statement of
the same fact. ‘ Give me any three guests
[the smallest possible party according to
the saying that a party should not be less
than the number of the Graces nor larger
than that of the Muses), it is not too
much to say (ί prope ’) that Ι may expect
each to have a taste for different fare.'

62. multum diversa : see on Sat. 1.
3. 57 ‘multum demissus‘

65. praeter cetera, ‘ above all other
reasons.'

me Romaene. The position of ⁴ ne '
with a word emphatic but not the first
in the sentence is anteclassieal. See in-
stances quoted by L. and S. from
Plautus. Horace means by adopting it
here to give special emphaffls to ‘ me ³
as well as to ‘ Romae.' It would be in
prose ‘ Ego Romae poemata‘?’ ‘ Do you
think I am the man, Rome the place,
to write poenis Ῥ ’ then he explains first
that Rome is not the place and he not
the man, vv. 66-86; then he explains
that he is speaking of fine poetry (note
the emphatic repetition of ‘ poema ' iu
v. 109) not verses such as passed in the
mutual admiration eliques of the day.
