when the schools reassemble in larger
number after the holidays (see on Sat.
1. 6. 75). This interpretation seems at
first sight to give a smoother connec-
tion between vv. 18 and 193 but there
is no true relation between the picture
of Horace's compositions used as a
school-book, introduced, as it is, as the
final indignity that they are to suffer;
and this charge to them to keep alive
the memory of his personal character-
istics and history. A break is required,
for there is a real change of tone in
v. 19, and the true purpose of the
Epistle asserts itself in distinction from
the playful and ironical tone of the
earlier part.

20. libertino patre. Cp. Od. 2. 20.
5 and Sat. 1. 6. 45.

tenui re : ibid. 71.

21. maiores nido. For construction
see on Sat. 2. 3. 310. With the metaph.
cp. Epp. 2. 2. 503 with the feeling cp.
Od. 3. 30. 12 ‘ex humili potens.’

23· primis placuisse : Sat. 2. 1. 76,
Epp. 1. 17. 35. The question is raised
whether ‘ belli domique ’ qualifies ‘ pla-
cuisse' or ‘primis' The first is the
most natural both in view of rhythm
and of construction. It also makes
Horace's boast here correspond to the
grounds of the jealousy felt towards
him of which he complains in Sat. 1. 6.
46 foll. ‘ Quem rodunt omnes libertino
patre natum, Nunc quia sim tibi Mae-
cenas, convictor, at olim Quod mihi
pareret legio Romana tribuno.'

24. eorporis exigui. See for a jest-
ing allusion to this characteristic Sat. 1.
3. 308, and the extract from Augustus'
letter to him in the Suetonian life, vol. 1.
Introd. ‘vereri videris ne maiores libelli

tui sint quam ipse es,' etc. Cp. also

Epp. 1. 4. 15 n.

praeeanum: ‘ante annos albo ca-

pillo' Porph. The word is not found
elsewhere, but this seems certainly the
meaning. Horace speaks of ‘albescens
capillus' in Od. 3. 14. 25, written some
four years before this Epistle (cp. Od.
2. 11. 15). He was at that time forty.
We may notice that the expression here
is of a general characteristic, ‘ one who
whitened early.’

solibus aptum. Ritter well para-
phrases ‘aptum’ by ‘sactum natura‚’
‘ whom nature meant for sunshine,' the
plur. as in Epod. 2. 41 ‘perusta so—
libus.'

2 5. irasci celerem. For the inf. see
vol. i. App. 2. ᾗ 1. For the character-
istic cp. Sat. 2. 3. 323, 2. 7. 35; also
Od.1.16. 22, 3. 9. 23, 3. 14. 27. So
perhaps with a fellow feeling Epp. 2.
2. 102 ‘ genus irritabile vatum.’ Doubt-
less like the person he describes in Sat.
1. 3. 29, he was open to criticism on
this score, and meets it halfway. Cp.
Cic. ad Att. 1. 17. 4 ‘ et irritabiles animos
esse optimorum saepe hominum, et
eosdem placabiles.'

ut = ‘ ita ut‚’ ⁴ with the further char-
acteristic that’; Epp. 1. 16. 6 and 12.

27. Decembres. Horace was born
in December. The Suetonian life says
‘sexto idus Decembres‚’ i. e. Dec. 8,
B. C. 6 .

28. 51‘he year indicated is Β. c. 21, in
which M. Lollius was for some months
sole consul, the second place having
been kept for Augustus, who declined
it. Later in the year Q. Aemilius Le—
pidus was elected as his colleague, Dion
Cass. 54. 6. On the bearing of these
lines on the date of the publication of the
Epistles see Introd. p. 208. The exact
meaning of duxit has been questioned.
The Scholiasts interpret it by ⁴ sortitus
est‚' as though it were ‘sorte duxit.' ln
that case it is not used technically (for
