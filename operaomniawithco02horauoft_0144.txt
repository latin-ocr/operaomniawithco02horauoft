132 HORATII SATIRARUM

18-263( Since Ι lost my own business, Ι have made up for it by minding that of

everybody else. Ι was known as the great connoisseur, and dealer in everything‚
from antiquities to houses and gardens.'

26, 27. H. ¹ 1 know, and Ι wondered how you got rid of that madness.’

27—30. D. ‘ As others do——the madness only changed its place.’

31. Horace makes a light answer, and Damasippus goes on more seriously to
1ay down the truth that has explained life to him, and so reconciled him
to it.

31-76. ‘ I was going to drown myself for shame; but Stertinius saved me from
that folly, and bade me become a philosopher, by explaining to me that I was
no worse than others—only one more madman in a mad world. Everybody
is mad but the true philosopher. It is only a choice of follies. Some are
afraid where no sear is—others are not afraid where they should be. Dama-
sippus is mad on buying old statues—Is not the money-lendes mad who sup-
plies him with means to do it? '

77—81. All passions are equally signs of madness—ambition-avarice—extrava-
gance—superstition.

82—157. Avarici? first. Staberius bade his heirs engrave on his tomb the amount
of the fortune he had lest. That seemed to him the one solid title to fame.
That is a madness which matches Aristippus, who flung away his money in
the desert. Money is of value, but only to use. Avarice is not thought mad-
ness‚ merely because it is so common. Why do you hoard? For sear you
come to poverty? Your petty economies do not affect the result. On
the other hand if you can live on so little, why commit such crimes in order to
get more? See the picture of the wealthy miser Opimius, dying of starvation
for sear of the eost of a rice pudding.

158-222. Is the man who spends his life on ambz'tz'on less mad? Servius Oppidius
of Canusium, when he was afraid of signs of avarice in one son and extrava-
ganee in another, not only forbade them either to increase or diminish their
patrimony, but specially forbade either to accept a public office, as sure to
lead to waste of money on the vain attempt to ape the wealthy. Poor Ajax
was mad when he slaughtered the sheep—was not Agamemnon, when for fame
and power he slew his daughter?

225-280. The extravagant spending on luxury. Look at the types of the spend-
thrist: Nomentanus, the moment he has inherited a fortune, summoning all
the ministers of his pleasure and (in effect) dividing it between them—‘You
deserve it more than Ι ’: the son of Aesopus meltinga valuable pearl to drink:
the sons of Arrius breakfasting on nightingales. 1f a grown-up man took to
childish sports all would put him down as mad. Are not the follies of love
as childish? the changes of mood—the silly omens—the baby-talk—and it
ends in murder and suicide.

281—295. Suferslition—the old man who used to ask the gods to give him im—
munity from death—‘ one was such an easy savour’; the mother who vows
that if her boy is saved from a sever he shall do something which is sure to
give him another.

296—299. ⁴ You see Stertinius armed me well—and anyone who calls me a madman
now will get as good as he gave.’

300—326. H. ¹ You are a perfect Stoic—so tell me what is my madness—I do not
see it)
D. ‘ Madmen never do.'
H. ‘ Be it so⁷ but tell me.‘
