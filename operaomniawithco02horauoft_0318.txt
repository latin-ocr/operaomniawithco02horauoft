HORATII EPISTULARUM

Temptantem maiora, fere praesentibus aequum.

Contra, quem duplici panno patientia velat, 25
Mirabor, vitae via si conversa decebit.

Alter purpureum non exspectabit amictum,

Quidlibet indutus celeberrima per loca vadet,

Personamque feret non inconcinnus utramque3

Alter Mileti textam cane peius et angui 30
Vitabit chlamydem, morietur frigore si non

Rettuleris pannum.

Refer et sine vivat ineptus.

Res gerere et captos ostendere civibus hostes

Attingit solium Iovis et caelestia temptat:

Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est. 35
Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum.

Sedit qui timuit ne non succederet.

24. temptantem: cp. v. 343 lifting
his thoughts to.

fere with aequum. Either in the
sense of ‘tolerably ' or of ‘ as a rule ’z
see note on Sat. 1. 3. 96.

25. panno = ῥάκει, a contemptuous
term for the τρίβων or coarse eloak of
the philosophers.

duplici, because the Cynics wore no
undergarment (χιτών) but doubled the
cloak instead: so Juv. S. 13. 122
‘Stoica dogmata . . . A Cynicis tunica
distantia,' i.e. by the presence or ab·
sence of a tunic.

patientia: cp. ‘ patienter ' in v. 13 ;
‘endurance.' Cic. de Or. 3. 17 ‘ab
Antisthene, qui patientiam et duritiam
in Socratico sermone* maxime adamaret,
Cynici.’

27. ” alter, Aristippus. Horace is
following the traditional picture of him,
cp. Diog. Laert. 2. 60 διό ποτε Στρά-
τωνα, οἱ δὲ Πλάτωνα, πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰπεῖν·
Σοὶ μόνῳ δέδοται καὶ χλαμύδα φορεῖν καὶ
ῥάκος.

29. i6neoncinnus‚ ‘awkwardly'; Epp.
1.18. .

30. Mileti textam: cp. Virg. G.
3. 306 ‘ quamvis Milesia magno Vellera
mutentur Tyrios incocta rubores.’

eane peius et angui, ‘a dog or
snake’: see on Od. 3. 11. 49. The
expression is doubtless proverbial. Both
dog and snake were of unlucky omen
to meet3 see Od. 3. 27. 2 and 5. ‘ Peius
vitabit' seems, as wilkins says, an ex-
tension of the use in ‘peius timet ’ Od.
4. 9. 50. The MSS. vary between

Esto!

‘angui' and ‘angue' Priscian notices
the use of ⁴ angui ’ in this place.

32. ineptus. Notice how this word
gives the final verdict on the impraeti-
cable Cynic and sets the writer free
for his new approach to the subject.

33—42. For the general purport of
these lines see the analysis. Some irony
is no doubt to be felt in the heroic tone
of the commencement, and in the ap-
parent reference in vv. 37, 38 to Horace's
doctrine <set out in Epp. 1. 65 that men
are to be measured not so much by their
ideals as by the thoroughness with which
they pursue them.

33. res gerere, of warlike enter·
prises. The reference is to Augustus;
his triumph ΒΕ. 29 and the successes
spoken of in Epp. 1. 12. 26 foll. Tibe—
rius was associated in the latter, and it
has been suggested that he is included
in this reference, and that it is his favour
especially which Scaeva is contemplated
as seeking.

34. Compare the expression of Od.
3. 3.10-12‚ 4. 2. 17, 18.

36. A Greek proverb οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς
ἐς Κόρινθον ἔσθ’ ὁ πλοῦς, is quoted by
Aer. Several explanations are given of
the danger originally intended, the pre-
valent one being that it meant ‘ Few
have the long purse needed for the
expensive vices of Corinth.' In any case
the application here is quite general.
‘There are pleasures and dignities which
are not for everyone.'

37. The tone reminds us of the sami-
liar story of Sir W. Raleigh ς ‘ Fain
