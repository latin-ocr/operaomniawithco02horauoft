HORATII ARS POETICA.

Filius Albini: Si de quincunce remota est

Uncia‚ quid superat?

An haec animos aerugo et cura peculi

Cum semel imbuerit, speramus carmina fingi
Posse linenda cedro et levi servanda cupresso?
Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poetae,

Aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vitae.

Quicquid praecipies esto brevis, ut cito dicta

Percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles;

the intervals ofmoncymaking and house-
keeping, id. pp. 497, 498.

longis rationibus: ‘long sums.'

326. centum, as the edd. point out,
stands as a round number, ‘into any
number of fractional parts'; the Roman
mode of computing money, as we see in
the following sketch osan examination
in arithmetic, was by the 12 parts of
the ‘ as.‘

dicat. The schoolrnaster is supposed
to call for an answer.

327. Albini: ‘ feneratoris cuiusdam
avari’ Scholiast. A likely guess, but
probably not more.

poteras dixisse. Perhaps better with
Schiitz, ‘you might have told me [by
this time]’ <for 'poteras’ cp. Sat. 2.
1. 16 n.‚ the perf. infin. regular), than
with Ritter. etc.5 ‘you used to be able
to tell me' If taken in this latter sense,
we should give to the perf. infin. the
sense of ⁴ to tell at once.' Bentley would
read, with some inferior MSS„ ‘ pote-
rat‚’ the words then beingHorace's, ⁸ sup-
pose he could answer‚ “a third ofthe as.”'

329. redit, ⁴ is put the other way‚' i. e.
is added to the original ‘ quincunx)

330. an: this is the reading of B. and
was in V. The rest of Keller’s MSS.
have ‘Art' which is meaningless In
two of the Bland. MSS. Cruquius re—
ports ‘ ΑΠ’ as having been altered in
a second hand to ‘ At.' Itis clear, then,
that this was an early mistake in the
MSS„ and the choice seems to lie be-
tween ‘An’ and ‘Atf Keller prefers
the latter, on what. under the circum-
stances, seems the slight ground that it
is nearest to ⁴ Ad ’3 Schiitz for the more
serious reason that there is nothing in
the preceding words which justifies a
direct question introduced by ‘An‚' a

use which is limited by Madv. L. G.
ᾗ 453 to ‘supplementary questions’
intended to meet an objection, or con-
firm a statement, or suggest an answer
to a previous question. See also MadV.
on Cic. de Fin. 1. 2. 5, where he accepts
‘ An,’ though less well attested, in pre-
ference to ⁴ At! The point is a diffieult
one. ‘An’ in the argumentative sense
is used frequently elliptically‚ the ellipsis
being sometimes more obvious and
sometimes less. Ι defer therefore to
the authority of B and V, and to the
tact in Latin scholarship of Bentley anzi
Munro, and leave ‘Ans It must be
supposed that the picture of a sordid
education, which has just been given,
has been virtually equivalent to a pro-
nouncement that Roman poetry cannot
have the artistic qualities of Greek
poetry. The question, then, is supple-
mentary, as Madvig requires.

aerugo z see on Sat. 1. 4. 101. Here
it is a poisonous canker of the mind;
but the figure suggests that it is caught
from the handling of rusty coin.

cura peculi: Virg. Ecl. 1. 33. The
choice of the phrase is meant to imply
a love of money which suits a slave
rather than a free man.

332. linenda cedro. The resinous
sap of the ‘ cedrus ' was used to preserve
books as well as other things from
moths and from decay: Ov. Trist. 3.
1. 13 ‘ Quod neque sum cedro flavus,’ 1.
1. 7 ‘ nec cedro charta notetur’ Pers. S.
1. 42 ‘ cedro digna locutus.’

cupresso : ⁴ ex cupresso ligno confici
solebant capsulae’ Comm. Cruq.‚ ‘utra-
que res odore suo submovit tineas‘ Aer.

336. dociles . . . fideles, predicative:
‘ with willing ears and faithful memo-
ries.
