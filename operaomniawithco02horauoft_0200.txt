188 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE VII.

DAVUS, OR FREEDOM AND SLAVERY.

A DIALOGUE during the Saturnalia between Horace and his slave Davus.

Verses 1-5. D. ‘ 1f1 could only have my turn at fault finding.'

H. ⁴ Is that Davus '?

D. ‘ Yes, Davus, not a bad bargain to his master, sor all his faults.'

H. ‘ well, use the licenee of the Saturnalia, and say your say.’

6-20. Davus starts off in the style in which Horace represents a Stoic lecturer as
dechiming, with stock instances to illustrate his picture of life.

‘ Mankind is divided into those who are consistent in their vices, and those
who hover between vice and virtue.

‘ Priscus was an instance of the last, Volanerius of the first, and his lise was
the less miserable of the two.’

21—45. Horace interrupts. ‘ What a long preamble, what does it all refer to '?

l). ¹ To you.’

ll. ‘ How, villain ⁷¹?

D. ‘ You praise moderatiori but don’t practise it. You praise the country
when you are in town —the town when you are in the country. If you are not
asked out to dinner, it is all “a dinner of herbs.'' If an invitation comes rather
late you are in a fuss and fury to be gone. The poor parasite who meant to
sup with you goes away disappointed, but he sees through you, and is more
honest than you are. Nay, I, your slave, am more osa philosopher than you.
Don't srown at me; listen to the lessons which I pieked up from the porter at
Crispinus' lecture-room.'

46—71. Davus then begins again with a coarse declamatory comparison, evidently
(from vv. 53, 54 ‘ proiectis insignibus, annulo equestri. . . prodis ex iudice
Darna ³) not addressed personally to Horace, between the vices of slaves and
those of their masters, to the disadvantage of the latter, as worse and leading
to a more hopeless slavery.

72794. He supposes Horace to protest: ‘non suni moechus’3 but brushes the
excuse aside with the Stoie doctrine that abstinence from viee from seeondary
motives is no true abstinenee. (Cp. Epp. 1. 16. 46 f.) ‘ Yon are a slave whom
no manumission can free. Ι am at most your deputy slave or your fellow
slave. No one is free, but the wise man, who is master of himself. That is
not the position of one who is at the beck and call of a mistress.

95-101. ‘ So you share your slave’s other faults. He loiters to look at pictures
(after his degree), so do you: though they call you a man of taste for it,
while they call him a lazy fellow.

102—111. ‘ He likes a smoking cake3 your virtue is not proof against a good
supper. If he gets a thrashing‚ you get a fit of indigestion. It is as bad to
sell your estates to seed your gluttony, as for a slave to exchange his master's
‘¹ strigil ‘’ sor a bunch of grapes. [Davus is getting away from Horace agaim]
