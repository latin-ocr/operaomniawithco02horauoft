HORATII ARS POETICA.

Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.

Laudavere sales: nimium patienter utrumque
Ne dicam stulte mirati, si modo ego et vos

Legitimumque sonum digitis callemus et aure.

Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis,
Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora.

269. See on Epp.1.19.11.

270. vestri proavi. Some inferior
MSS. have ‘ nostri.' Bentley pointed
out that ‘vestri‚‘ besides being better
attested, is more suitable in the mouth
of the ‘ libertino patre natus ' addressing
Pisos. For Horace's views on Plautus
cp. Epp. 2. 1. 170 s.

272. ego et vos. He compliments
the Pisos by taking it for granted that
their taste is as his, not as that of the
rougher critics of the theatre.

273 belongs to the ‘sales’ of Plautus,
274 to his ⁶ numeri?

273. seponere, as ‘secernere’ Sat.
1. 3. 113.

274. digitis: either simply by count-
ing or by beating time (cp. ‘pollic1s
ictum' Od. 4. 6. 55, ‘pedum et digi-
torum ictu intervalla signant’ Quint. 9.
4. 51).

callemus, with accus, as even in
Cicero, pro Balbo 14. 32 ‘iura calles.‘

275 f. The precept to spend nights and
days over Greek models leads naturally
to a short historical sketch of the suc-
cessive masters of the Greek drama.

275. ignotum genus. Bentley (on
Phalaris) warned us that this is not ‘ an
unknown kind of tragic poetry‚’ but
‘ tragedy, a kind of poetry unknown
before.' Thespis, according to the Parian
Marble (see above on v. 220) was the
first to exhibit tragedies. According to
Aristotle (as quoted by Themistius Or.
26, p. 382,——he is not named in the
Poetics) he added the πρόλογος and
ῥῆσις, that is, he provided an actor dis-
tinct from the ἔξαρχος of the chorus who
could speak before the chorus entered,
and hold dialogue with the ἔξαρχος
afterwards; in other words he first made

tragedy dramatic. In the following

lines Horace seems to have been con-
fusing the traditions of tragedy with
those of comedy. Thespis no doubt
used, if he did not originate, the ἔλεος,
01· table, which was the first form of the
stage platform. The waggon belongs
to eomedy, which owed its rudimentary
form to the badinage (ἐξ ἁμάξης) of the
vintage procession. In ‘ peruncti faeci—
bus' Horace is probably giving a re-
ceived etymology of τρυγῳδία (as in
v. 2 20 of τραγῳδία), the name for comedy;
see Arist. Ach. 499, Liddell and Scott
s.V.‚ and Bentley’s Phalaris. It should
be said that Bentley would save Horace’s
credit in respect of the waggons by
reading, ex coni„ ‘ qui' for ‘ quae' in
v. 277, so that Thespis would be said to
carry his company of playerS, not his

la s.

p 2338. post hunc. Aeschylus is with
Horace, as with Aristotle, the next name
to Thespis in the growth of Tragedy,
intermediate writers as Phrynichus being
omitted.

With respect to the inventions here
assigned to Aeschylus, Horace is at
one with Aristotle (apud Themist. l. c.)
as to the stage, ὀκρίβας, ‘ pulpitum,' an
enlargement of the ἔλεος of Thespis,
which went with Aeschylus' addition,
which Horace does not mention, of a
second actor besides the ἔξαρχος.

The painted mask χ* persona ’) as used
on the tragic stage was traced to him,
although a simple linen mask to dis-
guise the sace had been employed by
Thespis and others. The tragic dress
(‘ palla,' σύρμα, see on v. 215: ‘hones—
tae' = σεμνῆς) was also attributed to him,
ἐξεῦρε τὴν τῆς στολῆς εὐπρέπειαν καὶ
σεμνότητα Athen. p. 21 E; and the
tragic shoe, ἐμβάτης (Suidas) or κόθορνος.
