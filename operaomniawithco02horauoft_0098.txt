86 HORATII SATIRARUM

Oro qui reges consueris tollere, cur non 34
Hunc Regem iugulas? Operum hoc, mihi crede, tuorum est!

34. qui consueris, ‘ since you are,' Od. 3. 13. 13 ‘fies nobilium tu quoque
etc. fontium‚' Epp. 1. 9. 13 ‘ Scribe tui
35. operum. For the gen. see on gregis hunc.’

SATIRE VIII..

CANIDIA.

THE first, probably, of Horace's attacks on Canidia. See Epod. 5, and especially
the introductions to Epod. 17 and Od. 1. 16, and compare Epod. 3. 8 ; Sat. 2. 1. 48.
2. S. 95.

The Scholiasts (on Epod. 3. 8 and on v. 24 of this Satire) say that under the
name of Canidia was satirized one Gratidia ‘ unguentaria Neapolitana.' With this
exception we have no external assistance in reading the riddle of the poems them-
selves. We are to imagine a woman whose fascination Horace has felt though he
resents it, and which he attributes with more or less of irony to magic. The ludicrous
catastrophe of the Satire as well as the mock heroic air which flavours the narrative
seem to forbid us to take it quite seriously ; cp. in this respect Od. 1. 16 inti-od.

The scene of the Satire is the Campus Esquilinus, the plateau from which the
several arms of the Esquiline hill are thrust out. It was without the ‘agger’ of
Servius Tullius and had been used ‘ as an extensive burial place sor the lowest class
of people, and a place of execution sor criminals.’ Cp„ besides this Satire, Epod. 5.
99. Sat. 2. 6. 33, Burn's Rome and the Campagna‚ p. 225. Maecenas had
recently become possessor of it and had laid it out in pleasure gardens. He even—
tually built a residence there (Od. 3. 29. 10, Epod. 9. 3). The Satire thus becomes
the vehicle of a compliment to one who is already Horace’s patron. The speaker
throughout is Priapus, a rough wooden image of the garden god (Virg. G. 4. 110)
which has been erected in the new garden. The transformation of the ground is
barely complete. There are still ‘magna sepulchra‚' and bones to be found by
scratching the ground. It is still haunted apparently by witches. With the
witchcraft os this Sat. cp., besides Epod. 5 and 17, Theoc. Idyll 2, Virg. Ecl. 8,
Tibull. Eleg. 1. 2, Ov. Met. 7. 179 foll.
