362 HORATII EPISTULARUM

106-125. Perhaps you mean, and perhaps it is true, that it is best contentedly
to write bad poetry. Writing good poetry is a very serious business. The
poet has to criticize himself severely. The ease you admire is won by efforts
which eost him torture.

136-140· And is it worth the pains? To lose one's illusions is not unmixed
gain, as the man at Argos found out.

141-144. But to be serious. It is time to wake up to the true purposes of lise.
Poetry must go among other playthings fit only for boys,

145. So Ι am trying to get by heart the teachings of philosophy.

[He begins accordingly with single commonplaces on Avarice (the passion
usually attacked first, see Sat. 1. Ι), but presently slides into a philosophical
lecture in his own person and in his usual style]

146 ³48· If you found a physical thirst growing insatiable you would be alarmed
and go to a doctor. Why are you less anxious about a [hirst of the soul?
149—157. If it was clear a prescription did you no good you would give it up.
The world prescribes getting as a remedy for avarice—you find it makes you

no better ; why do you go on with it?

158—181. Cut at the roots of avarice by learning that property itself is a mere
dream. The lawyers tell us ‘ use confers ownership.' They might go
further : use is ownership, in the only true sense of that word. Real ownership
is barred by the lirnitations of human life. What is the good then of accumu-
lating wealth in all its various forms?

182—204. Ι do not value it. If you ask why, 1 ean only say ‘it is my idiosyn-
crasy.' Ι am for enjoying, yet I know how to draw the line short of extrava-
gance and live in the happy mean.

205-212. You say you are free from avarice. well, are you free from other
passions too? It is little to get rid of one if others remain.

213—216. Right living is an art. If you have not learnt it it is time to give place
to those who have. If life is a banquet, you have had your share and had
better retire betimes.

The natural explanation of the Epistle is that some fresh and unusual pressure
has been put upon Horace to induce him to abandon the abstention from further
lyric composition which he anuounced in Epp. 1. 1, possibly by Florus, as repre-
senting the younger generation of sympathetic men of letters, possibly by Tiberius,
through Florus, desiring that celebration of his youthful exploits which a few years
later Horace aecorded to him. Horace throws into the shape of a letter to Florus his
reasons sor maintaining his resolve. They are in form to a great extent playful and
satirical. The description of the motives which alone drove him to write poetry are
not meant to be taken quite literaHy, though he would have us understand that
philosophy was genuinely his first love. So the further excuses, which amount
pretty much to ¹ J am not in the mood for lyric ve1·se‚’ are all put in a paradoxieal
and humorous way.

‘ Ι am too old’ ; but lyric poetry is treated (in the same ironica] vein as in Od.
4. 1) as concerned wholly with ‘love‚ banquets, wine.' ‘ You ask sor Udes, but
others prefer my Epodes or Satires,’ as though his success in so many lines made a
fresh difficulty in taking again to one. ‘ Rome is too noisy,⁷ as if he lived always
in Rome and could not escape to his Sabine valley. Then comes a satirical pas-
sage in which he hits the more popular but less highminded poets of the day,
⁴ success in poetry in these days means the condescending to puff and be puffed ' ;
cp. Epp. 1. 19. 35-41. Then a more serious one, in which in deseribing what poetry
