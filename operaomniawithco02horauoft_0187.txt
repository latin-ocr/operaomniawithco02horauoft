 

LIB. II.

SAT. 5.

Demissum genus Aenea, tellure marique

Magnus erit, forti nubet procera Corano

Filia Nasicae metuentis reddere soldum. 65
Tum gener hoc faciet: tabulas socero dabit atque

Ut legat orabit3 multum Nasica negatas

Accipiet tandem et tacitus leget, invenietque

Nil sibi legatum praeter plorare suisque.

Illud ad haec iubeo:

mulier si forte dolosa 70

Libertusve senem delirum temperet, illis
Accedas socius; laudes, lauderis ut absens.
Adiuvat hoc quoque; sed vincit longe prius ipsum

Expugnare caput.
Laudato.

Scribet mala carmina vecors:
Scortator erit: cave te roget; ultro 75
Penelopam facilis potiori trade.'

Putasne ?

Perduci poterit tam frugi tamque pudica,

Quem nequiere proci recto depellere cursu?

‘Venit enim magnum donandi parca iuventus,

Nec tantum Veneris, quantum studiosa culinae. 80
Sic tibi Penelope frugi est, qui si semel uno

De sene gustarit tecum partita lucellum,

Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto.

Me sene quod dicam factum est: anus improba Thebis

genus, of a single descendant, as
‘ Valeri genus' Sat. Ι. 6. 12. Cp. Od. 1.
3. 27, and Virg. Aen. 6. 500‚just quoted.

65. metuentis: shrinking from as
from something to be avoided if possible.

soldum, his debt in full, as Cicero,
Rab. Post. 17. 46 ‘ita bona veneant ut
solidum cuique solvatur.’ Some edd.
imagine the debt to be money bor-
rowed of Coranus, which he hopes to
be exmsed, in return for his daughter3
others think of him as generally in-
debted and hoping for a legacy to
put him straight. The story and per-
sonages are apparently familiar (notice
e. g. the epithet ‘procera,’ which adds
nothing to the scene as an ideal one)
and needed no explanation. In his
wider circle of readers Horace is content
to leave much to the imagination, which
will fill in the details variously. For

the s6yngzopated form ‘ soldum' see on Od.
1. 3 . .

67. multum, as Epp. 1. 3. 15 ‘mon-
itus multumque monendus.'

69. praeter plorare, χωρῖς τοῦ
κλαίειν. It may be doubted whether
‘praeter' is used here as a preposition,
the infinitive being treated as an
accusative in government after it, or
rather as an adv.:‘praeterquam'; see
Madv. ᾧ 172. III. obsi 2.

suisque. Even his daughter has got
nothing by the sacrifice.

71. delirum, ‘ doting‚⁷ as usually in
Cicero, ⁴ senex ’ de Or. 2. 18. 75, ‘anus'
de Div. 2. 68. 142, Tusc. D. 1. 21. 48.

temperet, ‘ rule.'

84. me sene. Prof. Palmer points
out the play by which Tiresias, speaking
as a shade, is made to refer back to his
old age in the actual way that a living
person says ‘ me pue1·o,’ etc. He speaks
in character and lays the scene of the
Story at Thebes. The edd. show that
Roman jurisprudence discouraged foolish
and malicious instructions as to the
