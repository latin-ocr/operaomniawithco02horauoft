‘Nil opus est te,

Circumagi; quendam volo visere non tibi notum ;

Trans Tiberim longe cubat is prope Caesaris hortos.'

Incipit ille :

Non Varium facies: nam quis me scribere plures

truth. He is so unconscious of the
distastefulness of his company that he
has no fear of being taken literally.

16. prosequar: ‘ Ι will attend you.’
The external evidence is fairly divided
between this word and ‘ persequarz’
‘I will follow to the end.’ It is a
common point of variation in MSS.
On intemal grounds we may prefer
‘ prosequar,' the usual word for compli-
mentary attendance, as giving a softer
tone to the preceding word. The point
is the unconseiousness of the interlo-
cutor, not his brutality. ‘Persequar'
would leave less room for the answer
‘ nil opus est te circumagi.' There 15 3
variety also in the punctuation-some
editors putting a stop at ⁴ prosequar ’ 01
‘persequar‚' and marking the following
words as a question. This stopping
seems to suit best the reading ‘perse-
quar?

18. cubat, ‘is ill in bed,' as Sat. 2. 3.
289 (cp. Epp. 2. 2. 68). There are three
reasons given why he should not come
too—the friend to be visited is unknown
to him, he lives a long way off, and he
is ill.

21. subiit. See on Od. 1. 3. 36 and
Sat. Ι. 4. 82.

22. Viscum, one, no doubt, of the
‘two Visci whom Horace names in the
next Satire, (‘haec utinam Viscorum
laudet uterque' Sat. 1. 10. 83) among
the literary men whose judgmenthe cared

for. There is also Viscus Thurinus (again
in the company of Varius) at Nasidienus*

doubtfully, ⁵ optimi poetae‚’ ‘ alii dicunt
criticos fuisse‚' both conjectures from
the passages in Horace. They say the

father ofistwo was Vibius Viscus, a 11611 ' ⁷

knight and a friend of Augustus. Some
MSS. of Porph. read in this place
‘Fuscum’

23. Varium. See on Od. 1. 6. 1.
Note the nature of the accomplishments
on the ground of which he claims to be
ranked before Varius—he ean write
verses (not well, but) fluently (cp. the
picture of Crispinus in Sat. 1. 4. 13
foll), he can dance (cp. Sat. 2. 1. 24,
and Cic. Mur. 6 ‘nemo saltat sobrius,
nisi forte insanit '), he can sing better
than Hermogenes, Horace’s ideal of
effeminacy and bad taste; see Sat. Ι. 4.
72, and introd. to Sat. 1. 3.

25. mollius, from Lucr. 4. 789
‘mollia membra movere‚' and ib. 980;
the alliteration is part of Lucretius‘ art,
but it is purposely adopted here to give
a mincing tone to the speaker and pour
contempt on the accomplishment of
which he boasts.

26. est, tibi mater? Orelli thinks
that this is only a question os formality,
its sole purpose being to interrupt the
man's list of accomplishments. Of
many suggestions perhaps the best is
that like Davus's ‘frugi quod satis est
Ut vitale putes ⁷ (Sat. 2. 7. 3), it implies
that too great perfectiori is dangerous to
life, and that it is therefore ironical. The
man, however, is too much wrapt up in
himself to perceive the irony.
