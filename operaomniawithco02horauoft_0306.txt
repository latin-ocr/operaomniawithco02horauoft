HORATII EPISTULARUM

Contendat laqueo collum pressisse paternum3

Mordear opprobriis falsis mutemque colores?

Falsus honor iuvat et mendax iufamia terret 39
Quem nisi mendosum et medicandum? Vir bonus est quis?
‘Qui consulta patrum, qui leges iuraque servat,

Quo multae magnaeque secantur iudice lites,

Quo res sponsore et quo causae teste tenentur.'

Sed videt hunc omnis domus et vicinia tota

one.’ ‘ Idem ' is best taken of the same
subject as before, viz. ‘ populus.' Bentley
put a slightly different turn on the sen-
tence by changing the question at the
end of v. 38 to a sullstop and making
⁴ idem '= ¹ ego.²

clamet: ‘should raise the hue and
c1·y.‘ ‘Me esse ’ has to be understood
with furem.

37. ‘ To strangle your father’ is with
Horace a proverb for, crime of the
deepest (lye, Od. 2. 13. 5, Epod. 3. 1.

38. colores. Bentl. explains of going
red and then white, and compares Prop.
1. 15. 39 ‘multos pallere colores? ‘to
turn white of different shades.’ Some
MSS. have ‘colorem‚‘ which Schiitz
adopts.

40. mendosum z with definite re-
ference back to ¹ emendatus' in v. 30.

medicandum: ‘ in need ostreatment.’
For the metaphor cp. vv. 21—24, which
are perhaps actually in view, Cp. also
Epp. ῐ. 8. 7-10. A false reading ‘men-
dacem‚' corrected by Bentl.‚ had crept
into some good MSS„ and was given by
the earlier edd.

vir bonus est quis ⁴? The argument
takes a fresh start. Dependenee on the
world's praise has been deprecated on
the ground that if you accept its praise
you must accept its blame—the one may
be as false as the other. He now attacks
it on another ground. ‘It is based on
appearance only. What do they mean
by a “vir bonus'' ’ἓ The answer only
covers outward respectability. The
man whom the world calls “ bonus ⁷' may
be known in his home and even in his
neighbourhood as a rogue.’

41—43. This, like vv. 31, 32, is the
answer of the person whom Horace is
addressing. On the face of the Epistle
this is Quintius, but the personal reser-
ence to himself has passed away, and
though the second person is still used it
indicates only an imaginary interlocutor.
For Horace's practice in the matter see

the note on Epp. 1. 1. 28.

‘ Bonus’ was used in many conven-
tional senses, as e. g. by Cicero for ‘ men
of our side‚' ‘ sound politicians‚’ and lent
itsels easily to ironical applications. Cp.
Cic. Att. 9. 12. 3 ‘ Praetores ius dicunt,
aediles ludos parant, viri boni usuras
perscribunt.⁷ Horace is not throwing
any doubt on the reality of goodness,
but pointing out the limited senses in
which the term is popularly used.

We may compare on the whole Cic.
de Off. 3. 19. 77 sor the story of Fim-
bria's refusal to arbitrate on the ques-
tion whether M. Lutatius Spinther was
a ‘ vir bonus’ on the ground that this
turned on matters beyond observa-
tion.

41. The whole line means one who
keeps within the four comers of law
in all its forms and aspects. ‘Patrum
consulta' is variation of the technical
‘ senatus consulta.’
see on Sat. 1. 1. 9.

42. quo iudice secantur, i. e. such
a person as, whether by the agreement
of the two parties or by appointment of
the ‘ praet0r‚' will be set to decide grave
civil suits. ‘Secantur’ is a popular or
a poetical, not a technical term, Sat.
Ι. 10. 15.

43. Ni‘oney is safe when he is the
security, a cause when he is the witness.
There is some zeugma in the use of
tenentur, which is an habitual phrase
for winning a cause, as Cic. pro Caec.
24. 67 ‘ Scaevolam dixisti causam apud
centumviros non tenuisse.'

The reading quo res sponsore rests
solely on V as quoted by Cruquius, all
extant MSS. having ‘responsore’ It
has been accepted by all recent editors
except Ritter. K. and H. give it, but,
in accordance with their depreciating
view of V, prefer to consider it a con-
jectura] emendation of Cruquius.

44. vicinia: Sat. 2. 5. 106, Epp. 1.
17. 62.
