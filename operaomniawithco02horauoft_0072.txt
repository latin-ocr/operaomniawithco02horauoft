60 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE V.

THE JOURNEY TO BRUNDISIUM.

THE idea of the Satire was from Lucilius. ‘Lucilium hae satira aemulatus
Horatius iter suurn a Roma usque ad Brundisium describens quod et ille in tertio
libro fecit, primum a Roma Capuam usque et inde fretum Siciliense.' A few frag-
ments os the model exist: for one effect of its influence see note on p. 6.

A chief purpose doubtless of the Satire is to give a picture of the poet's relations
to Maecenas, the freedom and absence of servility which characterize them; the
literary circle with which they were shared‚ the absence, even at a critical moment
in state affairs, of any politica] bearing in the intimacy.

So strongly is this last characteristic reflected in the poem that it lacks any
reference to public events by which we might have fixed the occasion and date of
the journey.

The only occasion on which we know of an arrangement having been concluded
at Brundisium between Octavianus and Antony was the so-called peace of Brundi-
sium in B.C. 40 (the occasion of Virgil's 4th Eclogue), when Maecenas represented
Octavianus, Pollio Antony, and Cocceius was added as a referee (κοινὸς ἀμφοῖν
Appian, Bell. Civ. 5. 709). This is excluded by the conditions of the case, as
Horace was certainly not admitted to Maecenas' circle before B.C. 38; see Introd.
to Satires, pp. 3, 4. It is however alluded to in v. 29, where Maecenas and Cocceius
are called ‘ legati aversos soliti componere amicos? Kirchner (followed by
Franke, Orelli, and Ritter) maintained that the journey belongs to the ‘ treaty of
Tarentum’ in the spring of B.C. 37. Antony came on that occasion to Brundisium,
as though that were the place appointed for meeting, but being ill—received by the
inhabitants went on to Tarentum, where eventually terms were arranged through
the intervention of Octavia, who called in the help of Maecenas and Agrippa as
friends of Octavianus <Plut. Ant. 35). There is no further evidence as to any
journey of negotiators on behalf of Octavianus to Brundisium, and if they also went
on to Tarentum it is not explained why Horace stops the story where he does.
Schutz has lately suggested, with great probability, that the reference is to the pre-
vious mission of Maecenas to Antony, then probably at Athens, in the autumn of
38 (Appian, B. C. 5. 728). Horace would then have accompanied him to the place
of embarcation. It is natural that Maecenas should associate with himself for such
a purpose Capito, who was a personal friend of Antony, and Cocceius, who had
been previously employed by both sides as an impartial adviser. Cocceius is
probably the M. Cocceius Nerva who was consul in B.C. 36, the great-grandfather of
the Emperor Nerva. L. Fonteius Capito was ⁴ consul suffectus ' in B.C. 30. We

find him immediately after the ‘treaty of Tarentum' in Antony's company, and ·

employed by him to bring Cleopatra to Syria.

1-6. Horace starts with Heliodorus and travels along the Via Appia, the first day to
Aricia. the second to Appii Forum, reaching it in the evening.

7-26. The journey is continued through the night by boat along the cana] [which
had been part of a scheme of Octavianus for draining the Pomptine marshes
(see A. P. 65)]. They land late in the morning, and have three miles to climb
to Anxur on its cliffs.

27—33. Here the negotiators join them, coming possibly by sea.
