HORATII SATIRARUM

Gaudes si cameram percusti forte, penes te es?
Quid, curn balba feris annoso verba palato,

Aedificante casas qui sanior?

Stultitiae atque ignem gladio scrutare.

Adde cruorem
Modo, inquam,

275

Hellade percussa Marius curn praecipitat se
Cerritus fuit, an commotae crimine mentis
Absolves hominem et sceleris damnabis eundem

Ex more imponens cognata vocabula rebus?

280

Libertinus erat, qui circum compita siccus

‘ quid, si‚’ete.‚ Epp. 1. 19. 12 ‘ quid, qui‚’
etc. Epp. 2. 1. 40, with argumentative
questions enforcing or refuting what
had been said.

Picenis is an ‘ epitheton ornans?
The best apples came from Picenum,
Sat. 2. 4. 70.

273. eameram, ‘the arehed roof.'
He is deseribing an amusement of lovers
shooting apple—pips from between their
thumb and finger at the ceiling‚ to
see whether their love was returned,
the omen being favourable when they
hit.

For percusti see on Sat. Ι. 5. 79 and
2. 7. 68 ‘evasti.'

penes te, ‘ under your own contr01,’
i. e. ‘ sane.’

274. feris: interpreted by Persius'
imitation (ι. 35) ‘tenero supplantat
verba palato'; ‘trip up your lisping
words against an old man‘s palate.’ Cp.
⁴ balbutit ’ Sat. 1. 3. 48 ; and see on the
name ‘ Balbinus ' ib. 40. He is speak-
ing of the mincing baby-talk of lovers.
In an old man it is a proof of second
childhood.

annoso palato. Cp. the frequent
hypallage in the Odes ‘ adulteros crines ’
1. 15. 20, etc.

273—280. Love leads not only to
childishness but also sometimes to deeds
of violence.

275. cruorem, ‘ blood' = ‘ deeds os
blood.'

adde means, suppose them added,
what will your judgment then be of my
proposition?

276. ignem gladio scrutare. A
translation of the Pythagorean proverb
πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ μὴ σκαλεύειν. It is given,
amongst other places, in Diog. Laert. 8.
IS, and is explained by δυνατῶν ὀργὴν
καὶ οἰδοῦντα θυμὸν μὴ κινεῖν. Possibly
μαχαίρᾳ meant originally a cook's knife 3

and the saying was equivalent to ‘ do not
make a hot fire hotter.’ But like the
other proverbs it had probably various
turns given to it. Horace possibly mis-
translates, at any rate gives his own
application of it. Cp. his use of γναθ-
μοΐσι ’γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισιν in v. 72 of
the Satire. Cp. also his reference to
another Pythagorean proverb in Sat. 2.

modo, ‘just now.’ Heindorf put the
stop at the end of the line, taking ‘ modo,
inquam ' with the preceding words, and
Keller (Epilegomena) advocates this
punctuation ; but ‘inquam’ has little
force in that place.

277. Nothing is known of this story
oflove, murder, and suicide, but what
Horace tells us.

For cum praecipitat ep. above, v.
61 ‘ cum edormit.' For the form of
suicide cp. Od. 3. 27. 61 foll„ and the
story of Sappho's leap.

278. commotae mentis: see on v.
20 .

280. ex more, ‘ as men so often do.'

cognata voeabula, i. e. ‘scelus ’
and ‘ commota mens ’ are names which,
though not the same, are first cousins to
one another—the distinction is without
a difference.

281-295. The superstitious. The in-
stanees are a freedman who hoped by
prayers to escape the universal debt of
mortality; and a mother, who, in her
anxiety for her boy's recovery from an
agne. vows that if he gets well he shall
do that which is sure to bring the illness
back in a worse form.

281. circum compita: see on v. 26.
Here the ‘ compita ' are named as places
where there were altars to the ‘Lares
compitales.'

siccus. He had not drunk; the ex-
planation os his folly did not lie there.
