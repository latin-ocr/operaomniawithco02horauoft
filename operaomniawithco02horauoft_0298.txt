HORATII EPISTULARUM

Dicet eques; sed equi frenato est auris in ore).

Maior utrum populum frumenti copia pascat3

Collectosne bibant imbres puteosne perennes 15
Iugis aquae; (nam vina nihil moror illius orae3

Rure meo possum quidvis perferre patique;

Ad mare cum veni, generosum et lene requiro,

Quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

In venas animumque meum, quod verba ministret, 20
Quod me Lucanae iuvenem commendet amicae).

Tractus uter plures lepores, uter educet aprOS,

Utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent,

Pinguis ut inde domum possim Phaeaxque reverti,
Scribere tenobis, tibi nos accredere par est. 25
Maenius, ut rebus maternis atque paternis

Fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi,

1 3. sed equi, ‘ but it is the tug ofthe
rein, not the u ords, that the horse un—
demands) ‘ Equis ' which Bentley (fol-
lowed by Munro and wilkins) adopts
against the best MSS„ makes this a
general statement, and so loses point.

14, Horace begins his catechism with
necessaries, bread and water, and passes
on to luxuries. Note that bread and
water were the two things about which
he was most particular in his picture of
the journey to Brundisium, Sat. 1. 5. 7
and 88—91. ’

frumenti eopia will imply cheapness
and choiee.

15. perennes, wells fed by springs,
opposed to the intermittent supply of
tanks of rainwater.

16. iugis. V had ‘dulciss as have
a few other MSS. But we want an
epithet which will point the contrast
with ‘ collectos imbres‚’ as ‘dulcis' does
not. Keller suggests that the reading
was due to a reminiscenee of Virg. G. 2.
243.

nihil moror. ‘1 do not stop to
ask about ’; with obj. ace. as here Epp.
2. 1. 264, with obj. clause Sat. 1. 4. 13.
He does not trouble to ask the relative
value of the native wines of the district ;
none had any name. His practice at
the sea is to bring or buy better wines.

17. quidvis: more general and so
more forcible than ‘quodvis‚' se.
‘ vinun1.'

perferre patique: perhaps the

strength of the expression implies that
it requires some philosophy even in
Sabine air.

18. Perhaps this seaside regime is
implied in the ‘ sibi parcet ’ of Epp. 1.
7. ΙΙ. Note the contrast between his
mode of life, Epp. 1. 7. 12 ‘contractus
leget,' and Epp. 1. 14. 39 ‘glebas et
saxa moventem.'

With the description of what he looks
for from the more generous wine ep.
Epp. Ι. 5. 16 foll.

20. venas: see note on Od. 2. 2. 14.

21. Lucanae ι so he is thinking
chiefly of Velia ; see on v. 1.

iuvenem, predicative ; ‘make me
young and give me grace in the eyes‚’
etc.

22. apros z ep. ‘ Lucanus aper’ Sat. 2.

33. echinos: Sat. 2. 4. 33.

24. Phaeax. One of the ‘Alcinoi
iuventus' of Epp. 1. 2. 28. It is this
apparent recantation of so much of his
philosophy which leads directly to the
ironical apology of the remainder of the
Epistle. As the Scholiast puts it, ‘ quia
de se ut luxurioso locutus erat subicit de
Maenio fabulam.’

25. accredere, ‘to give full credence
to.’

26. Maenius: Sat. 1. 3. 21.

27. fortiter, ‘gallantly‚’ ‘ with
spirit’ ; said ironieally.
urbanus: Catuli. 22. 2 ‘dicax et

urbanus,' ‘ a wit.’
