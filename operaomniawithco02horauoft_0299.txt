Scurra vagus non qui certum praesepe teneret,

Impransus non qui civem dinosceret hoste,

Quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus, 30
Pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli,

Quicquid quaesierat ventri donabat avaro.

Hic ubi nequitiae fautoribus et timidis nil

Aut paulum abstulerat, patinas cenabat omasi

Vilis et agninae, tribus ursis quod satis esset3 35
Scilicet ut ventres lamna candente nepotum

Diceret urendos correctus Bestius.

keep to one crib, not one when he
wanted a dinner to distinguish be—
tween countryman and foeman.’ For
the order of non qui cp. Sat. Ι. 5. 33.

praesepe ; the metaphoris an old one
of a parasite, I’laut. Cure. 2. 1. 13, as
though he were an animal looking only
for a belly full.

literated, even that which to a Roman
would last longest.

31. He swept the market clean like
a hurricane‚ swallowed its contents like
a bottomless pit. The accumulated
figures are abundantly illustrated from
the comic poets, as Plaut. Capt. 4. 3.

labes larid0‚' Alexis apud Athen. 8. 21
ἐκνεφίας καταιγίσας . . . Ι εἷς τὴν ἀγορὰν
τοῦψον πριάμενος οἴχεται Ι φέρων ἅπαν τὸ
ληφθέν. Plaut. Curc. Ι. 2. 28 ‘Age
effunde haec cito in barathrum.’

32. donabat. Of the two readings
offered by the MSS„ this and ‘ dona1·at‚'
this, which is the reading of the majo-
rity, is the most pleasing; but it is quite
possible that Bentley was right in think-
ing that ‘ donarat’ of the Bland. MSS.
was a mistake for ‘donaret,' and that
this was the original reading: the sent-
ence is then comunimus, ‘ donaret ' being
in the same constr. as ‘teneret,' ‘ dinos-
ceret ' after ‘qui‚' and the apodosis be-
ginning with v. 33, the subject being
repeated in ‘ hic ⁹ because of the length
of the protasis.

wicked wit, or seared it? It is not
necessary to this sense that timidis
should be taken as partly governing the
gen. as Dillr„ quoting A. P. 28 ‘ timi-
dus procellae.’

34. paulum abstulerat, ‘had got
little spoil.'

patinas, ‘ plate after plate.'

omasi: Sat, 2. 5. 40.

35. agninae. Lamb is seldom spoken
of as an article of food, never, it seems,
as a delicacy. In the passage quoted
by the edd. from Plani. Capt. 4. 2⁴ 38
Ergastulus is speaking of the frands os
the market, ef selling stale fish for fresh,
etc.7 and he charges the butehers with
selling the meat of an old ram as though
it were young wether mutton, and so
(apparently) of passing off lamb at
twice its proper price as mutton, ⁴ dupla
agninam danunt.’

vilis seems to go with both substan-
tives.

36. seilicet ut. For the soree of
‘scilicet' before the consecutive ‘ut,'
calling attention to the length to which
his change of tone was carried, see on
Epp. 1. 9. 3.

lamna candente. For ‘lamna' see
on Od. 2. 2. 2. Red-hot plates of
metal are mentioned frequently as in—
struments of torture, as Lucr. 3. 1017,
Cic. in Verr. 5. 16. 163 ‘ardentes la-
minae, ceterique eruciatus.³

nepotum, i. e. of those who wasted
money on gluttony.

37. correctus Bestius. The expla-
nation of the words, whether we keep to
the text of the MSS. which only give
the choice of ‘ correctus ' or ‘ correptus‚'
or accept the emendation os Lambinus.
‘ correetor‚’ must equally be a matter of
conjecture : sor the clue to the reference
to Bestius is lost. Very possibly he was
