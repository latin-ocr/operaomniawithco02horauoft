HORATII EPISTULARUM

Vestimenta dabat pretiosa: ‘beatus enim iam

Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes,

Dormiet in lucem, scorto postponet honestum

Officium, nummos alienos pascet, ad imum 35
Thrax erit aut olitoris aget mercede caballum)

Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius unquam,
Commissumque teges et vino tortus et ira3

Nec tua laudabis studia aut aliena reprendes,

Nec cum venari volet ille, poemata panges. 40
Gratia sic fratrum geminorum, Amphionis atque

Paul, Eph. 5. 4 as the companion of
αἰσχρότης καὶ μωρολογία among τὰ οὐκ
ἀνήκοντα, The definition which comes
nearest to the signification of Eutrapelus
here is perhaps that of Aristode, where
he is describing the characteristics of
the young in Rhet. 2. 12 ἡ ’γὰρ εὐτραπελία
πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις, which seems to give
room for practical joking. Cp. the con-
duct of Philippus to his jvrotssssge' in Epp.
1. 7.

32. dabat. The story is told as ofthe
last generation 3 so the impft. in Epp. 1.
1 ·. 26 foll.

³beatus, ‘ in his pride and delight.’ The
Scholiast rightly points out that these vv.
32—36 ‘ beatus . . . caballum'give [he
thought of Eutrapelus. This explains
the future following ‘dabat.'

34. dormiet in lucem:
17. 6.

35. nummos alienos pascet. The
meaning seems fixed by Pers. S. 5. 149
‘nummos quos hic quincunce modesto
nutrieras? ‘ your money which you had
been nursing with a modest five per cent.'
So here < will seed the capital of others,’
i. e. will borrow at heavy interest. For
‘ nummos ' cp. Sat. 1. 3. 88. It hasbeen
otherwise taken as if ‘ nummos alienos '
were the same as ‘aes alienum,’ ‘will
let his debts grow large.’

ad imum, ‘ at the end‚’ A. P. 196.

36. Thrax: Sat. 2. 6. 44 n.

mercede: so ‘ mercede eolonum’ Sat.
2. 2. 1 15.

37. illius, as ‘ ille' in v. 40, the
‘ patron.' It seems the certain reading,
though ‘ ullius' is found in nearly all
MSS„ and had possession of printed
texts till Bentley. The link between
this precept and the next (vv. 39, 40) is
that both are warnings against egotism.

neque . . . que. The particles imply

Epp. 1.

that the two rules are on an equality:
‘you will no more forget the first than
the second.’

tu is emphatic, as contrasted with
‘ illius.’ If the secret is his you will not
on your side pry into it-jnst as if it
is trusted to you you will keep it
sacredly.

38. vino tortus. For the metaphor
of ‘ vino tortus ' cp. A. P. 435 and Oct,
3. 21. 13.

et ira: the anger probably not (as
Ritter) of those who wish to learn the
secret and threaten angrily if it is
withheld3 but of the recipient of the
secret, who is tempted by taurits or
false stories to lose his balance and
betray it.

39. nec . . . nee: as you will not

be so egotistical as in words to praise
your own pursuits and condemn every-
one else‘s, so in practice you will not
show your friend that you think your
literary pursuits superior to his field
s orts.
p40. panges: a word of Lucretius, 1.
25, 4. 8. It is used again in A. Ρ. 416
‘ ego mira poemata pango.' In both
places there is a touch of sarcasin in its
use, as though it implied some affecta-
tion.

41. gratia dissiluit: cp. Epp. Ι. 3.
32 ‘ gratia . . . coit et reseinditur.² The
story os the two brothers was told in
the Antiope of Euripides, which was
adapted by Pacuvius. Amphion the
player on the lyre<Od.3.11.1,A.P.394)
quarrelled with Zethus, the shepherd
and huntsman, as to the value ofmusic‚
but yielded sor peace and hid his lyre. It
will be notieed that there is a compli-
ment in the comparison of Lollius to the
more aecomplished brother deferring to
the rougher one.
