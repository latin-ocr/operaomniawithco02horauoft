18 HORATII SATIRARUM

92—100. Take care that you do not come to the end of Ummidius.

101, 102. ¹ So you mean I must turn spendthrist and prodigal.'

103-108. There is something between a miser and a prodigal—a happy mean.

109-116. He returns to his original point. Life is spoilt by perpetual discontent—
each trying to outdo his neighbour.

117—119. This is why we so rarely see Lueretius' picture of the ‘satisfied guest,'
ready to leave the banquet when his time comes and confess that he has
enjoyed it.

120, 1 21. Enough—you will think Ι have been at Crispinus* stores.

The reference to Lucret. 3. 938¹and 960 is made clear in v. 119 (see note on that
line), but Horace has the whole passage from v. 931 in mind; v. 957 might serve

as the text of this Satire‚ ‘ quia semper aves quod abest, praesentia temnis.'

QUI fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem

Seu ratio dederit seu fors obiecerit illa

Contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentes?

‘O fortunati mercatorest' gravis annis

Miles ait multo iam fractus membra labore. 5
Contra mercator, navem iactantibus Austris:

‘Militia est potior.

Quid enim? concurritur: horae

Momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta.'
Agricolam laudat iuris legumque peritus,

1. quam sortem .. . i11a= ‘ sorte illa
quam,’ the subst. being put with the rel.
instead of with the demonstr. See on
Epod. 2. 37.

2. dederit. . . obiecerit. The verbs
are suited to the substantives. Deliberate
choice assigns. Chance casts in one‘s
way: her mode of distribution is after
her kind, haphazard. The alternative
means ‘ however they corne by their lot‚’
whether they are responsible for the
selection or not. B. reads ‘ sors‚’ but
it has many miswritings in this Satire.
‘ Fors‚’ ‘ratio ' is a Cieeronian antithesis,
ad Att. 14. 13 ‘ sed haec fors viderit
ea quae talibus in rebus plus quam ratio
potest.'

3. laudet, μακαρίζει, ‘ commends‚'
i. e. not for their qualities but for their
lot. From the negative ‘ nemo' a posi-
tive subject (⁴ unusquisque ') must be
understood for ‘ laudet.'· So below, v.
109. For instances in prose see Madv.
ξ 462 b.

diversa sequentes, those who follow
another path.

4. gravis annis. Virg. Aen. 9. 246 :
cp. Liv. 7. 39 of veterans ⁴ graves aetate.’
On both sides Horace makes the moment

of grumbling the moment of feeling
the diseomfort of the profession. The
soldier when years and hard work be-
gin to tell on him ; the trader when he
is caught by bad weather. For the
latter cp. Od. 1. 1. 15, 2. 16. 1.

7. quid enim, τί -γάρ; Sat. 2. 3.
13²· Cp. our elliptical use of ‘why,‘
‘what.’ ‘Whyt there is the battle shock,'
etc.

horae momento, ‘ in an hour’s short
space.’ Epp. 2. 2. 172 ‘puncto mobilis .
horae.' Cp. Liv. 5. 7 ‘ horae momento
simul aggerem ac vineas . . . incendium
hausit!

9-1 2. Look into the law court. The
lawyer when he feels the pinch of his
profession, early and late, envies the
countryman. The defendant when he
has to make a journey from the country
to appear in court thinks how much
more convenient it would be to live in
town.

senses. It is ‘law' or ‘a body of
law.’ as opposed to a special enactment.
It is used of departments of law, ‘ius
gentium,' ‘ius honorarium,’ which did
