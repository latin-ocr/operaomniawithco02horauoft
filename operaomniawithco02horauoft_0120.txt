HORATII SATIRARUM

Ambitione relegata te dicere possum,

Pollio, te, Messalla, tuo cum fratre, simulque 85
Vos, Bibule et Servi, simul his te, candide Furni,
Complures alios, doctos ego quos et amicos

Prudens praetere0; quibus haec, sunt qualiacunque,
Arsidere velim, doliturus si placeant spe

Deterius nostra.

Demetri, teque, Tigelli, 90

Discipularum inter iubeo plorare cathedras.

84. ambitione, in the same sense
Tacitus <Hist. 1. Ι) speaks of ‘ambitio
scriptoris’ as one of the corrupting in-
fluenees in history,—the interested desire
to please.

85. Pollio. Od. 2. 1 introd.‚ supr.
v. 42.

Messalla: see on v. 28 of this Satire
on ⁴ tuo cum fratre‚' the Schol. annotate
‘ Publicola.' This they further interpret,
as we have seen, of ‘ Pedius Publicola '
mentioned in that place. But Messalla
had a brother called by Plutarch (Vit.
Anton. c. 65, 66), and the epitomizers
of Livy (122), Publicola, and by Dion
(47. 24 Gellius Publicola, who had
been an ally of Brutus and Cassius, but
conspired against thern, was forgiven on
account of their friendship for Messalla,
and subsequently commanded a wing
of Antony’s squadron at Aetium. Cp.
introd. to Od. 2. 3.

86. Bibule, a certain correction of
Heinsius for the reading of all MSS.
⁶ Bibuli). The corruption was (lue to
‘ vos ⁷ and to a misrendering of ‘Servi ’
as plur. voc„ which it could not be.
K. and H.‚ who print ‘Bibuli’ as
the MS. reading, equally denounce it
as a blunder. The person intended is
supposed to have been the youngest son
of the Consul Bibulus (Od. 3. 28. 8),
who was still a boy when his father
died, and his mother Porcia married
M. Brutus. We hear of him as at
Athens (and in company with Messalla,
Cic. ad Att. 12. 32) in 13.C. 45, and sub-
sequently at the battle of Philippi with
his step—father. This will account for
liis friendship with Horace. It also
seems that he wrote a memoir of M.
Brutus (Plutarch, Vit. M. Bruti 13 and

Servi, possibly the son of S. Sulpi-
cius Lemonia Rufus, the jurist and friend
of Cicero, os whose gifts and literary
tastes Cicero speaks in letters to his

father, ad Fam. 4. 3, 4, 13. 27; cp.
Phil. 9. 3, foll.

candide, Epod. 5. 5, Epp. 1. 4. 15
cp. Sat. 1. 5. 41, Epp. 1. 6. 68.

Furni, doubtless the person with re-
spect to whom Seneca tells a story (de
Benef. 2. 25) of his reconciling Augustus
to his father C. Furnius (friend and cor-
respondent of Cicero, ad Fam. 10. 25,
26),who had been a supporter ofAntony.
He was consul in Β. C. 17. In the Euseb.
Chron. occurs ‘ Furnii pater et filius clari
oratores habentur, quorum filius consu-
laris ante patrem moritur.’

88. prudens, ‘ if 1 omit any names
it is not that I forget them.'

89. spe deterius, ‘ less than Ι hope.'

90. Demetri. Nothing is known of
him but what can be gathered from the
text (ep. v. 18) ; for the omission of ‘ te'
before ‘ Demetri ’ Bentley compares the
omission of the first ‘ sive ’ as in Sat. 2.
8.16; cp. Od. 1.3. 16, 1.6. 19.

91. discipularum, ⁴ mimarum et his-
trionum‚' Comm. Cruq. ‘ ingenuarum,
quia hoc ternpore maximum earum
studium adfectandi lyricam disciplinam.'
Aer. For the first we may compare the
⁴ mimae ’ of Sat. 1. 2. 2, who mourned the
death of the other Tigellius. For the latter
Orelli compares the picture of Sem·
pronia in Sallust, Cat. 25 ‘ literis Graecis
et Latinis dicta, psallere et saltare ele-
gantius quam necesse est probae.'
Ritter adds the description of women's
education‚ Od. 3. 6. 21 foll. It may be
questioned, however, whether Horace
means to depict Demetrius and Tigel-
lius as professional singing-masters; or,
rather, as we might say, as drawing-
room critics, whose auditors would be
young ladies lounging on armchairs.
Cp. (Heindorf) Martial’s picture (3. 63.
5 foll.) of the ‘bellus homo ' : ‘ Cantica
qui Nili, qui Gaditana susurrat, Qui
movet in varios brachia volsa modos:
Inter femineas tota qui luce cathedras
