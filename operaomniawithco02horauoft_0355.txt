LIB. ΙΙ. EPIST. 1.

late in time of Greek culture, which has been slowly driving out the old taint
of rudeness and has not sully done its work yet ; the faults, in spite of their vigour
and spirit, of the early writers of tragedy and comedy, in their sels-sufficiency,
haste, and eagerness to make money.

Turning srom the writers of plays he goes on (v. 177 f.) to arraign the audiences
as equally wanting in the artistic spirit. They care for shows, not sor good plays
or acting. Lastly‚ after explaining in a few words that in what 116 says he is not
undervaluing the dramatic art, he turns (v. 214 f.) to other kinds of poetry, and
asks Augustus' support for them. ‘ I know,’ he says, ‘there are many of us who
bore you, but there are differences between 115, and happily you are not like
Alexander, you know a Virgil from a Choerilus. And you will reap your reward.
Good poetry is indeed “aere perennius.” I would do my part as your poet, if I

could, but bad poetry is worse than none?

The points of the Epistle are——
1. That it is ridiculous to judge poetry by its age not its intrinsic merit.
2. That the conditions of the development of Roman literature had made
it certain that perfectiori would come late.
3. That Augustus' taste is a true one; that Virgil and Varius, (and it is
hinted, Horace), have taken the right way to be classics‚ and so immortal, in a
sense that their predecessors had not.

special purpose in placing the name of
