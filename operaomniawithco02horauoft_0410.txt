394 HORATII ARS POETICA.

Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,

Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis 50
Continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter;

Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si

Graeco fonte cadent, parce detorta.

Quid autem

Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum

Vergilio Varioque ?

Ego cur acquirere pauca 55

Si possum invideor‚ cum lingua Catonis et Enni
Sermonem patrium ditaverit et nova rerum

Nomina protulerit ?

Licuit semperque licebit

Signatum praesente nota producere nornen.

49. abdita rerum: for the form see
on Sat. 2. 2. 25. They are the ‘ obseura
reperta’ which Lucretius tells us (Ι. 136)
require ‘ nova verba.'

50. cinctutis cethegis. For ‘ Ce-
thegis ' see on Epp. 2. 2. 117. The
meaning of‘ cinctutus ’ must be gathered
from (ι) Ov. Fast. 5. 101 (the only other
place where it occurs), where it describes
the Luperci, who are spoken of by
Virgil as ‘nudi ’; (2) the parallel ex-
pression in Lucan 2. 54 =Exserti manus
vesana Cethegi ’; (3) Aul. Gellius 7. 12,
who says that the Romans at first wore
the toga only without a tunic. and then
‘substrictas et breves tunicas citra hu-
merum desinentes.' Porphyrion’s note
is in accord with this. ‘ cinctutis . . . quo-
niam cinctum est genus tunicae infra
pectus aptatae’

51. sumpta pudenter: cp. Epp. 1.
17. 44 ‘sumasne pudenter.’ For the

satirizes the inclination of early Roman
writers to overdo this liberty.

quid autem. ⁶ Quid’ is interr. ‘ what? ’
i. e. ¹ is there anything which ?' ‘ Autem '
is dramatie, as though the opponent
were supposed to assent to the general
dictum, but to limit it to past genera-
tions.

Cicero uses a similar argument as be-
tween Greek and Roman writers de F in.
3. 4. 15 ‘ Si enim Zenoni licuit cum rem
aliquam invenisset inusitatam inaudi-
tum quoque ei rei nomen imponere cur
non liceat Catoni ’ (i.e. for the younger
Cato, the interlocutor in the dialogue) ;
see the whole of the passage.

54. Caecilio: Epp. 2. 1. 59.

55. Vergilio Varioque: Epp. 2. 1.
2 .

4I7t is to be noticed that Macrobius de-
fends virgil from the charge of intro-
ducing Greek words (such as ‘lychni,'

proviso cp. Quintil. 6. 5. 71 ‘usitatislot‘ffiaedalusss ‘aethra ') showing that he

tutius utimur: nova non sine quodam
periculo fingimus!

52. habebunt fidem. We are close
to the metaphor of coinage, which be-
comes distinct in v. 59.

53. detorta : ‘ derivata ’Comm. Cruq.
It is a continuous metaphor, viz. that
of irrigation. The waters must come
from Greek sources, and the sluices must
be opened sparingly. Horace allows of
but two ways of meeting the demand
for more powers os expression ; the first,
which he savours and which he prac-
tised, namely‚ to make old words do
new service by skilful setting3 the
second, which he allows if sparingly
used, to bring words from the more co-
pious Greek. In Sat. 1. 10. 20 f. he

was following older poets‚ and that he
used the license more sparingly than
the .

5y6. invideor for ‘invidetur mihi)
Cp. ‘ imperor’ Epp. ι. 5. 21 n.

Catonis: Epp. 2. 2.117. He names
the earliest master of prose and of verse.

59. ‘ To give to the world words that
bear the mintrnark of the day.' pro-
ducere occurs, in the similar passage
Epp. 2. 2. 119. It has not the full me-
taphorical colour of the other words,
but from its place here it acquires the
sense of ‘ to put in currency.’ Bentley’s
conj. ‘procudere ’ completes the technical
terms at the expense of the completeness
of the figure.
