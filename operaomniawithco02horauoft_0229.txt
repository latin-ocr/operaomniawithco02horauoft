EPIST. 1.

217

Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque, 25,
Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebity l
Restat ut his ego me ipse regam solerque elementis.

ι ⁴- Non possis oculo quantum contendere Lynceus,

Non tamen idcirco contemnas lippus inungi3

Nec quia desperes invicti membra Glyconis, 30
Nodosa corpus nolis prohibere cheragra. ἱ

Est quadam prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.

25, 26. prodest . . .nocebit. The
future adds ‘ by and by, though it may
not seem so at the moment,' and it suits
the comparison in its clause between
successive stages of lise. The young
see no evil resultS, but they will follow
equally.

27. restat : till Ι attain to the
system, Ι must do what I can with so
much of the alphabet of philosophy as
Ι have learnt.

his : such as are exemplified in the
rest of the Epistle.

ego me ipse emphasizes again that
his aim is practical and personal. He
is not going to mount the professor's
chair.

regam solerque : the practical aims
of moral philosophy, guidance in con-
duct, and the attainment of content and
tranquillity. ”

28—31. These lines contain an apo-
logy. ‘Little is better than nothing!
They also offer a first example of the
‘elementa’ of philosophical common-
place of which he speaks.

28. non possis: see on Sat. 1. 1. 45.
The omission of the concessive or con-
ditional particle, that is, the return to
eo-orclinate construction, has the effect
of contrasting more forcibly the possible
hypothesis and the impossible conclu-
sion which might wrongly be drawn
from it. Notice that in using the second
person henceforth in the Epistle (at
least until v. 95), Horace has in view
not Maecenas. but an imaginary dispu-
tant or object of his- teaching. b'ee
note on Epp. 1. 16. 41—43.

oculo contendere: lit. to make an
effort with the eye, as Cic. Lig. 3. 6
‘voce contendere.’ Bentley, following
Lambinus, with small MS. authority,
reads and argues sor ‘ oculos,’ though
allowing that both construetions are

Fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus;

lawful. The position of ‘ contendere'
makes it the inf. not after ‘ possis‚’
but after ‘ potuit ' or ‘ potuisset,' in the
rel. clause.

Lynceus: one of the Argonauts,
famous sor keenness of sight. Pind.
Nem. 10. 62 κείνου γὰρ ἐπιχθονίων πάν-
των ’γένετ’ ὀξύτατον ὄμμα.

29. lippus inungi: Sat. 1. 5. 30.

30. Glyconis Lessing pointed out
that a famous athlete, Glycon of Per-
gamum, is the object of an epigram by
Antipater of Thessalonica, a contempor-
ary, as appears, of Horace. Otherwise his
name is unknown, and as early as Acron
the conjecture ‘ Milonis’ had been sub-
stituted in some copies. Curiously‚ Milo
is the name in the sentence which is
quoted from Epictetus, and which pos-
sibly was suggested by this passage:
οὐδὲ ’γὰρ Μίλων ἔσομαι, καὶ ὅμως οὐκ
ἀμελῶ τοῦ σώματος· οὐδὲ Κροῖσος, ἀλλ’
ὅμως οὐκ ἀμελῶ τῆς κτήσεως.

31. cheragra: Sat. 2. 7. 16.

32. est, ἔξεστι. Sat. 2. 5. 103.

quadam . . . tenus. The tmesis as
in Virg. Aen. 5. 603 ‘Hac celebrata
tenus.’ ‘Quadam ’ is one of the many
true readings received into the text of
Horace by Cruquius on the testimony
of V. It had been conjecturally re—
stored by Lambinus, but has since been
found in most of the best MSS. The
earlier readings were ⁴ quodam' and
‘ quoddam.’ The latter made no sense,
the former is contrary to the usual
formation of adverbial compounds of
‘tenus‚' which have the fem. abl. as
⁴ hactenus,’ ⁶ aliquatenus.’

33. fervet. Perhaps, ‘is fevered,'
the metaphor being continuous in this
and the two following lines. Cp. Sat.
2. 3. 79 ‘luxuria . . . aut alio mentis
morbo calet) Otherwise we should
take it as Cicero's ‘ fervet ferturque
