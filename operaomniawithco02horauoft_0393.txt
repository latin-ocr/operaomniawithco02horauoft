Si cupidum timidumque minus te, nempe rubereS,
Viveret in terris te si quis avarior uno.

Si proprium est quod quis libra mercatus et aere est,
Quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus;

Qui te pascit ager tuus est, et vilicus Orbi,

160

Cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,

Te dominum sentit.

Das nummos, accipis uvam,

Pullos, ova, cadum temeti: nempe modo isto
Paulatim mercaris agrum, fortasse trecentis

Aut etiam supra nummorum milibus emptum.

165

Quid refert vivas numerato nuper an olim?
Emptor Aricini quondam, Veientis et arvi,

156. cupidum timidumque: Epp.
1. 2. 51, 1. 6. 9.

nempe, here ‘in apodosi‚' it empha-
sizes the ‘reductio ad absurdum⁷; if
wealth could do all this, why your blushes
would be needed for being too little
anxious, not too greatly, about wealth.

158 f. Lueretius 3. 971 had used the
legal distinction between ‘mancipium,’
perfect ownership, and ‘usus,' occupa-
pation, enjoyment, to illustrate the
tenure of lise, ‘Vitaque mancipio nulli
datur, omnibus usu! Horace, in Sat.
2. 2. 1 29—1 35‚applies the same thought to
the tenure of property: ‘ property can-
not be of longer tenure than lise itself’ ;
we can have the ‘usus’ of it, but ‘ pro-
prium* is a wrong word to use. This
thought is worked out more sully here,
but Horace calls into use another
technicality of the Roman lav-⁷, namely,
the principle of ‘usucapio,‘ viz. that
uninterrupted possession for a limited
time gave absolute ownership. ‘All
ownership,’ he says, as in the former
case, ‘is limited by the conditions
of human lise’3 but he adds ‘limited
ownership is as good as unli1nited,’
and he interprets ‘usus' (perhaps as
in Epp. 1. 12. 1—4 in the light of the
further technical term ‘usus fruetus')
to mean enjoylnent. ‘If you get the
fruits of the field, the field is yours
to all intents and purposes, in the only
sense in which anything can be said to
be yours.'

158. libra et aere. In the formal
act of ‘ mancipatio,’ or the transference
of ‘res mancipi,' one of the witnesses
held a pair of scales and the purchaser
touched them with a coin of bronze,

which he then gave to the vendor.
This archaic custom is described by
Gaius, Inst. 1. 119.

mercatus . . .
the majority of the better MSS. includ-
ing V. Many edd. prefer ‘ mercatur.’

159. quaedam: not ‘some kinds of
property,’ sor there is no distinction
contemplated between ‘res mancipi'
and ⁴ res nee maneipi,’ and the principle
of ‘usucapio' applied to both, but
‘ property sometimes.’

consultis: i.e. ‘iurisconsulti5,’ as in
v. 87 and Sat. 1. 1.17.

160. Orbi, some unknown rich pro-
prietor.

161. daturas: the reading of the
Bland„ and more pointed than ‘ daturus ⁹
which K. and H. prefer.

163. nempe modo isto, ‘why, you
see, in that way.’ It emphasizes the
point at which, by the argument, the
collective ‘agrum' is substituted for
the detailed products of the ‘ ager.’

166. You count out the price in suc-
cessive yearly payments to the bailiff.
Orbius eounted it out once sor all.
What is the difference‘?

167. The converse of the proposition
in vv. 163-165. Thai was ‘the man
who buys the produce virtually buys,
and so owns, the field) This is ‘the
man who bought the field, however
long ago, virtually buys the produce
he consumes from it?

quondam: to be taken closely With
emptor3 ‘the sometime purchaser.'
Horace is fond of using verbal substan—
tives in the place of participles or rela-
tive clauses. Dillr. compares ‘late
tyrannus’ Od. 3. 17. 9, ‘prope victor'
