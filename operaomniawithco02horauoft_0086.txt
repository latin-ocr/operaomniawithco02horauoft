74 HORATII SATIRARUM

Saepe dat indignis et famae servit ineptus,

Qui stupet in titulis et imaginibus.

Quid oportet

Nos facere a volgo longe longeque remotos?

Namque esto populus Laevino mallet honorem

Quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret 20
Appius, ingenuo si non essem patre natus:

Vel merito quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem.

Sed fulgente trahit constrictos Gloria curru

Non minus ignotos generosis.

Quo tibi, Tim,

Sumere depositum clavum fierique tribuno? ²5
Invidia accrevit, privato quae minor esset.
Nam ut quisque insanus nigris medium impediit crus

poterat elatis ' = ‘elatis iis, quibus elatis
quisque poterat [exire].’

17. stupet in. Virg. Aen. 10. 446
‘ stupet in Turno.’

titulis to be closely connected with
imaginibus, the waxen masks of an-
cestry and the names and titles of honour
inscribed on the presses in which they
were kept. ‘Let us accept the judg-
ment of the world, want of rank is a
disqualification ἂ priori sor office, in the
opinion of people and aristocrats alike ;
and not unreasonably; but the tempta-
tion to play the donkey in the fable is too
strong for most of us.’ The answer to
the definite question ‘quid oportet nos
sacere'? would be, ‘to show our small
esteem sor rank more logically and
thoroughly.’

18. nos. Maecenas and Horace.
Their distance from the crowd is in
feeling not in birth. Bentley thinking
the expression arrogant would read
against the MSS. ‘ vos.'

longe longeque. Ov. Met. 4. 325,
and even in prose, Cic. de Fin. 2. 21. 68.

20. Decio . . . novo: ⁶ one of the
devotion os a Decius, if he was at the
same time ⁴· homo nox*us,”’ i.e. had had
no ancestor who had held a curule
office. For the devotion of P. Decius

moveret, sc ‘senatu'z ‘ strike from
the list of the senate' Cp.‘ movere
loco Epp. 2. 2 113, where the image
is of the censor revising the list of the
senate.

21. Appius. The reference is to

Appius Claudius Pulcher, censor B. C. 50,

who is named as exercising the office
with severity by Cic. ad Fam. 8. 14.

22. propria pelle, from the fable of
the ass in the lion's skin. Cp. Sat. 2. Ι.

23. trahit constrictos, ‘drags a
captive bound at her chariot 11110015.ν
The image of the personified love of
glory (φιλρτιμια)” 111 her triumpha] car is
repeated in Epp.2.1. 177 'ventoso
gloria curru.’

24. An instance of this enslavement
to the soolish desire of rank.

quo tibi. Madv. ξ 239; see on
Epp.1.5. 12.

Tilli. The Scholiasts say that the
reference is to one Tillius. a Pompeian
who was removed from the senate by
J. Caesar, and who after his death re-
sumed his dignities and became a ‘ tri-
bunus militumss There 15 nothing to
complete or corroborate this account.
He appears in v. 107 as a ‘praetor.
The laticlave gsee on Sat. 1. 5. 367, like
the sandal leathers of v. 27, is part of
the senator' 5 distinguishing garb It has
been explained 1n close connection with

‘fieri tribuno by reference to Suetonius*
statement (Aug. 38) that Augustus al-
lowed the sons of senators to wear the
laticlave, and on joining the army to be-
come at once ‘tribuni’ ·but we gather
from the context rather that Tillitgis was
of humble birthy and in v. 110 emphasis
is laid on the factos his being a senator.
He is represented as resuming his posi-
tion both civil and military.
