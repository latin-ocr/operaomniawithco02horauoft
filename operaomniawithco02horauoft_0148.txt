HORATII SATIRARUM

Traiecto lateris miseri capitisve dolore,
Ut lethargicus hic cum fit pugil et medicum urget.’ 30

Dum ne quid simile huic, esto ut libet.

‘O bone, ne te

Frustrere‚ insanis et tu stultique prope omnes,

Si quid Stertinius veri crepat, unde ego mira

Descripsi docilis praecepta haec, tempore quo me

Solatus iussit sapientem pascere barbam 35
Atque a Fabricio non tristem ponte reverti.

Nam male re gesta cum vellem mittere operto

Me capite in fiumen, dexter stetit et, Cave faxis

29. traiecto: acc. to Porph. a tech-
nieal word (Gr. μεθίστασθαι, μετάστασις)
for the shifting of disease from one organ
to another.

miseri, ‘ aching.⁷ Orelli quotes Plaut.
Poen. 5. 2. 43 ‘miseram buceam.' Cp.
Sat. 1. 9. 32 ‘laterum dolor,' where the
Scholiasts annotate ‘ pleuritis.'

30. ut cum, to be taken together,
ὡς ὅτε.

lethargicus eum fit pugil, etc.,
where he passes suddenly frorn the
‘letha1⁴gus,' which Celsus defines as
‘ marcor et paene expugnabilis dormi-
endi 11ecessitaS,’ to ‘phrenesisf in which
⁴ diffieilior somnus, prompta ad omnem
audaciam mens est ⁷ Cels. 3. 20. For a
picture of a ‘lethargicus' see below,
v. 142 f.

hie, δεικτικῶς, ‘yonder'; cp. v. 23
‘ huic.’

3¹- esto, ‘let it be'; ut libet echoes
the ‘ ut solet‚’ ‘ ut cum.' Horace seigns
to take Damasippus literally, and to ex—
pect to be assaulted himself.

o bone, ὦ ’Ὑαθέ, Sat. 2. 6. 51 ; the
voc. alone 16. 95, Epp. 2. 2. 37, in ear-
nest or affectedly earnest appeals. See
also in plur. Sat. 2. 2. 1.

ne frustrere z as is usual in Horace,
not an imperative, but a final clause,
‘that you may not deceive yoniself (let
me tell you) you also are mad? See on
Od. 1. 33. 1.

32. et tu, ‘ you also.'

prope omneS, as the Greek σχεδὸν
ἅπαντες, an habitual sostening of a
sweeping statement; see on Sat. 1. 3. 96.
With this discourse should be read
Cicero's rendering of the Stoic paradox,
ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται Parad. 4.

33. Stertinius: see Introd.

erepat: see on Od. 1. 18. 5. Add
Epp. 1. 7. 84, Plaut. Mil. G. 3. 1. 56,

of the man who would talk law at a
dinner-table, and Lucr. 2. 1168 of the
man who always harps on the good old
times3 ‘isthere is any truth in what is
always on Stertinius' tongue.’

unde, from whose lips; see on Sat. 1.
6. 12.

35. sapientem pascere barbam, ‘to
grow the beard ofwisdom‘; for the beard
as belonging to philosophers see on Sat.
1. 3. 133.

pascere, as Virg. Aen. 7. 391 ‘sa-
crum tibi pascere crinem?

36. Fabricio ponte: the bridge
(Ponte di quattro Capi) which still
exists between the island and the old
Campus Martius. It was built (Dion
Cass. 37. 45) B.C. 62. An inscription on
it says that it was built by ‘L. Fabri-
eius, curator viarum.'

37. male re gesta: for the phrase
and its correlative ‘bene rem gerere'
see infr. v. 74. With this picture cp.
Liv. 4. 12 ‘multi ex plebe, spe amissa,
. . . capitibus obvolutis se in Tiberim
praecipitaverunt.’

operto eapite, as in the passage of
Livy just cited. It was the familiar
attitude of meeting death. Socrates
covers his head in Plato's Phaedo, Caesar
in Suetonius, Jul.‚ 82, Decius in Liv.

ΞΒ. dexter, ‘on the right,’ and so
with good omen, as a good genius.
Virg. Aen. 8. 302, to Hercules ; ‘ Dexter
adi?

eave. The last syllable is shortened
in the conversational style, as infr. v.
177, Epp. 1. 13. 19. It is long in
Epod. 6. 11, so ‘vide ' in Pers. Sat. 1. 108.
The constr. ‘ cave laxis,’ without a nega-
tive particle, is found in Cicero as ‘ cave

putes,' ‘mind you do not think} ad
Fam. 10.12.1.
