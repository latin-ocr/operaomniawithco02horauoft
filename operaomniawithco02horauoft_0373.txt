Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur

Ire poeta, mcum qui pectus inaniter angit,

Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,

Ut maguS‚ et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis.
Verum age et his, qui se lectori credere malunt

Quam spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi, 215
Curam redde brevem, si munus Apolline dignum

Vis complere libris et vatibus addere calcar,

Ut studio maiore petant Helicona virentem.

Multa quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae

(Ut vineta egomet caedam mea), cum tibi librum 220
Sollicito damus aut fesso3 cum laedimur, unum

Si quis amicorum est ausus reprehendere versum3

Cum loca iam recitata revolvimus irrevocati3

Cum lamentamur non apparere labores

210. per extentum funem . . . ire :
a proverb os something very difficult.

21 1. inaniter, ⁴ by mere illusion ' : a
frequent word in Cicero. In ‘angit ’
‘terroribus ⁷ there is reference to the pity
and terror which, according to Aristode,
are the instruments of tragedy.

2 13. ut magus: as one who is master
of the ‘ terrores magici ' Epp. 2. 2.
208.

214. verum age : a formula of trans-
ition like Lucretius' frequently repeated
‘ Nunc age ⁷3 but Horace here goes with
Virgil (G. 4. 329. Aen. 7. 429, 12. 832)
in joining a second imperative by ‘et '
rather than (as Lucretius does, and as he
does himself in the case of ‘nunc age'
Epp. 1. 14. 31) treating ‘ age’ as a pure
exclamation—‘ Nunc age quod superest
cognosce ' Lucr. 1. 266.

his, ‘ of whom '—Horace would imply
—‘ Ι am one.⁷ The personal reference
of the last lines, and especially the con-
fession of his own taste ‘ quae facere ipse
1·ecusem‚’ have prepared the way for this
transition from those who write for the
stage to those who write for readers.

215. fastidia ferre superbi : Virg.
Eel. 2. 15 ⁴ superba pati fastidias

216. redde, ἀπόδος, ⁵ render‚⁷ as dne.

munus Apolline dignum, i. e. the
Palatine library. See introd. to Od. 1.
31; also Epp.1. 3. 17, 2. 2. 93.

217. addere calcar: as Cicero's ‘ ad-
movere‚' ‘adhibere calcar ' ad Att. 6. 1,
Brut. 56.

218. Helicona virentem: i.e.poetry

with all its charms.

219. multa quidem: concessive an—
swering to 2293 ‘ granted that we poets
give trouble, and by our own fault, yet
it is worth while to spend pains on
uS.’

220. ut vineta, etc., ‘to put the knise
to my own vineyard‚’ i.e. to criticise
myself and my friends. The nearest
likeness quoted for this proverbial ex-
pression is Tibull. 1. 2. 100 ‘ quid messes
uris acerba tuas‘?’ It is in accordance
with Horace's habitual irony to include
himself in his criticism on the want of
taste shown by his contemporaries

221. sollicito aut fesso. For Ho-
race's own care in the matter see Sat. 2.
1. 18, Epp. 1. 15. 3 ‘ Si validus, si laetus
erit, si denique poscet.⁷

laedimur. For the touchiness of
poets under criticism cp. A. P. 438
foll.

223. loca. Cic. and Quintil. always
use ‘loci ³ as the plur. in this literary sense
of ‘ passages]

revolvimus, ‘unroll again‚' i.e. to
read a second time.

irrevocati: ‘ revocare' was used of
an actor who is ‘ encored' ; as Cic. Sest.
56. 120 ‘ revocabatur ab universis <Ros-
cius) ’3 also of a poet at a ‘ recitation'
Arch. 8. 18 ‘ quotiens hunc Archiam vidi
revocatum eandem rem dicere commu-
tatis verbis atque sententiis.'

224. non apparere, ‘are not per—
ceived,’ ‘ are not properly recognized.'
