HORATII SATIRARUM

Castor gaudet equis, ovo prognatus eodem

Pugnis3

quot capitum vivunt, totidem studiorum

Milia: me pedibus delectat claudere verba

Lucili ritu nostrum melioris utroque.

Ille velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim 30
Credebat libris, neque, si male cesserat, usquam

Decurrens alio, neque si bene;

quo fit ut omnis

Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella

Vita senis.

vertigine tectum Ambulat et geminis
exsurgit mensa lucernis’ Juv. S. 6. 304.

26. No identity of other conditions‚
not the closeness of twin brothers, car-
ries with it identity of taste; the ref. is

ι to Homer's Κάστορα θ’ ἱππόδαμονᾈπὺξ

ἀγαθὸν Πολυδεύκεα (Il. 3. 237).

27. An adaptation osTerence's ‘Quot
homines tot seutentiae’Phorm. 2. 4. 14.

quot capitum,se.‘1nilia‘

28 pedibus claudere, Sat. 1. 10.
59. Here, as there, it is a depreciatory
phrase for verse making, putting the
mechanical pait soremost. Cp.‘conc1u-
dere versum 'Sat. 1. 4. 40.

29. melioris. The Schol. explain
‘ censu et natalibus‚' but, as Orelli says,
it is useless to ask in what respect
Lucilius was ‘a better man than either ⁷
of them. Itis a proverbial term. He
compares Lucretius’ remonstrance with
the man who complains of death, 3.
1025 ‘Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus
Ancu' reliquit Qui melior multis quam
tu suit, improbe, rebus.‘

30. A surther reason for writing
Satires, suggested through Lucilius. lt
is a vent for feeling, a substitute for a
friend's ear into which to pour one's
thoughts.

areana. . . . credebat. Cp. the ae-
count of Sappho's poetry, Od. 4. 9.
11 commissi calmes Aeoliae fidibus
puellae?

31. si male cesserat z ‘if things had
gone ill with him,’ a common phrase,
esp. in Ovid, and cp. Virg. Aen. 12.
148. The greatest number of MSS.
have ‘gesserat‚' a natural mistake in
copying an uncial MS. As Bentley
shows, the absolute use of ‘ gesserat’
without an accusative would be un-
paralleled.

usquam, with ‘alio,' ‘to any other
quarter whatever.' It has better autho-
rity than ‘ unquam‚' and has more force.

Sequor hunc, Lucanus an Apulus anceps:

33. votiva tabella. For the prac-
tice common in antiquity, as even now in
many countries, of vowing and offering
a picture of some escape from danger to
the power to whose good offices the
escape is attributed, cp. Od. 1. 5. 13,
and see Mayor on Juv. S. 12. 27. Per-
haps the figure is suggested by ‘de-
currens‚' ‘flying for refuge.’ In any
case the ⁶ votive picture’ carries the
suggestion of life outside literature as
a sea, if with ealms also with storms.
Such a picture at once paints the sea,
and proclaims that its subject has
reached the shore.

34. senis. Probably best taken 111
any case, as in Epp.2 . 1. 55 (of Pacu-
vius and Accius), as meaning‘ ancient⁷
‘though it belongs to a bv gone time,
his writings keeps a fresh picture of 1115
life? The other interpretation, ‘the
old man,' as though the point were his
long life, would be excluded on other
grounds if the dates in the Chron.
Euseb. were trusted, which place his
birth in 148 B. C., and his death in 1033
but Mr. Munro (in Journ. of Philol.,
vol. 8. p. 214) gave some reasons for
thinking that the first date should be
put twenty years earlier.

sequor huno. The second is the
emphatic word. ‘It is he that 1 am
sollowing.’

Lucanus an Apulus anceps: ‘ an-
ceps’ is prob. the nom.‚ ⁶ of whom it is
doubtful whether,' etc., as ‘incertus ’ is
used in Liv. 30. 35, Sall. Jug. 49. 5,
where see Kritz. For the geographical
point see on Od. 3. 4. 10. The auto-
biographical colour given to these lines
is perhaps suggested by the practice just
described of Lucilius in painting himself
in his Satires; but the special point of
the description is that which I have
indicated in the analysis of the Satire.
The position of the Venusines is a
