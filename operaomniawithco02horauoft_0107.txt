SAT. 9.

Debebat, quod ni fecisset perdere litem.

‘ Si me amas,' inquit, ‘paulum hic ades.'

‘ Inteream si ,

Aut valeo stare aut novi civilia iura;

Et propero quo scis.’
‘Tene relinquam an rem.'
Et praecedere coepit.
Cum victore, sequor.

‘Dubius sum quid faciam,’ inquit, 40
‘Me sodes?
Ego, ut contendere durum est
‘Maecenas quomodo tecum?’

‘ Non faciam ’ ille 3

Hinc repetit; ‘Paucorum hominum et mentis bene sanae;

Nemo dexterius fortuna est usus.

H aberes 45

Magnum adiutorem, posset qui ferre secundas,
Hunc hominem velles si tradere: dispeream ni

Summosses omnes.'

38. si me amas, ‘as you love me,'
a formula of earnest request‚ Cic. ad
Att. 5. 1 7, etc. For the hiatus and shoit-
ening of ‘me ’ cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 507 ⁶ te
amice! Horace has ‘ cocto num adest'
Sat. 2. 2. 28.

ades, a quasi-technical term of those
that give help and countenance in court.
It appears from such passages as Cic.
Rose. Am. 1 (‘ ita fit ut adsint propterea
quod officium sequuntur, taceant autem
quia periculum metuunt⁷) that such
countenanee did not imply actual ad-
vocacy.

39. stare, the meaning is doubtful.
(1) Acron took it rof recent editors
Ritter follows him) of the physical
fatigue of standing in court. (2) Porph.
(followed by Macleane) ofstanding still,
waiting. (3) Heind., Orell.‚ and Dill¹'.
follow Torrentius in taking it sor ‘to
appear in court) Torrent. quotes from
Ulpian for the use of ‘ sta1·e‚’ and com-
pares the term ‘ statores' for the officers
of the court. Of these (2) seems to be
inadmissible both as involving a ques-
tionable use of ‘ valeo ’ and as anticipat-
ing the later excuse ‘et propero quo
scis.'

41. rem : nearly synonymous with
‘litem.‘ Cic. Mur. 12. 27 laughs at the
lawyers for not having been able in all
these years to settle ‘ utrum rem an
litem dici oporteret.’

44. hinc repetit, ‘makes this fresh
beginning.’

paucorum hominum, ‘ choice in his
friends.⁷ It was a current phrase z Ter.
Eun. 3. 1. 18 ‘ sie homost : perpaucorum
hominum‚' and in a fragment of Cic. de
Fato preserved in Macrob. Sat. 2. 12,

‘Non isto vivimus illic

Scipio who has received a sturgeon and
is inviting more ofhis visitors to stop and
eat of it than Pontius, who is staying in
the house, approves‚ is remonstrated with
in the words ‘ vide quid agas, acipenser
iste paucorum hominum est.'

45. It has been doubted whether the
comparative ahl. after ‘dexterius ’ should
be ‘eo' (sc. ‘Maecenate ') or ‘te’ (sc.
‘ Horatio '). The first is rather the more
probable. ‘ Te ⁷ would probably be ex-
pressed. Also this strong statement
would be inconsistent with the question
just asked, ‘Maecenas quomodo tecum? '
The suggestion is that Maecenas is so
exclusive and so wide awake that
Horace will be none the worse for a
seconder in his attempts to improve his
acquaintance.

46. ferre secundas. sc. ‘ partes.'
There is the same metaphor Epp. 1. 18.
1 3 ‘ vel partes inimum tractare secundas‚’
osan obsequious friend. It is worked
out more sully in Cic. Div. in Q. Caec.
25 ‘ ut in actoribus Graeci fieri videmus
saepe illum qui est secundarum aut ter-
tiarum partium, cum possit aliquanto
clarius dicere quam ipse primarum, mul-
tum summittere, ut ille princeps quam
maxime excellat. sic faciet Alienus : tibi
serviet, tibi lenocinabitur, minus ali-
quanto contendet quam potest?

47. hunc hominem, sc. ‘me,’ as in
Ter. and Plaut. an imitation of the
Greek τόνδ’ ἄνδρα.

tradere, ‘to introduce.'
3, 1. 18. 78.

48. summosses, ‘ clear from your
path ’ (as in the usual ‘ i, lictor, summove
turbam ⁹). There is a want of delieacy
in the word as well as in the idea which
