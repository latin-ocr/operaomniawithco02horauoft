ΜΒ. 1. SAT. 3.

The musician Tigellius of this Satire (vv 3—19) and of the last (vv. 1—4> is iden-
tified with the Tigellius of Cicero's letters (ad Att. 13. 49, 50, and 51, ad Fam.
7. 24). He was the nephew (or grandson) of Phamea (named in these letters
and ad Att. 9. 9; 9. 13, and ad Fam. 9. 16), a rich sreedman from Sardinia.
He had quarrelled with Cicero because he thought him slaek in a cause of
Phamea‘s which tha great orator had undertaken‚ but was prevented from pleading
by the fact that the case of P. Sestius carne on the same day. We gather from
the letters that he was a favourite of the dictator Caesar. Cicero speaks (to
Gallus ad Fam. 7. 14) with contempt of his Sardinian origin, ‘hominem pestilenti-
orem patria sua.’ ‘ Habes Sardos venales : alium alio nequiorem.’ He calls him
‘salaconem’ (σαλάκωνα), ‘a swaggerer‚’ and speaks of him as ⁴ addietum Calvi
Licinii Hipponacteo praeconio.' Porph. (on this Sat. v. 1) has preserved a line
of that lampoon, ‘ Sardi Tigelli putidum caput venit.'

The Scholiasts identify him with the ‘Hermogenes Tigellius' of 1. 4. 72, 1.
10. 80, the ‘ Hermogenes' osv. 129 of this Satire and of 1. 9. 25, 1. 10. 18, and the
‘Tigellius' of Sat. 1. 10. 90. It seems clear however that this was another and a
younger person. The Tigellius of Sat. 1. 2. 3 and 1. 3. 4 is already dead. The
Hermogenes Tigellius of 1. 4. 72 and 1. 10. 80 is still alive, although Sat. 1. 4
contains internal evidence of having been composed later than Sat. 1. 2 (cp. 1. 2.
27 and 1. 4. 92), and Sat. 1. 10 of having been composed later than Sat. Ι. 4
(see 1. 4. 11 and 1. 10. 50). We may add that whereas the elder Tigellius was
lampooned by Calvus, Hermogenes Tigellius in Sat. 1. 10. 19 is said to sing

ν Calvus's songs.

OMN1BUS hoc vitium est cantoribus, inter amicos

Ut nunquam inducant animum cantare rogati,

Iniussi nunquam desistant. Sardus habebat

Ille Tigellius hoc. Caesar, qui cogere posset,

Si peteret per amicitiam patris atque suam non 5
Quicquam proficeret; si collibuisset ab ovo

2. cantare, an instance of the govern-
ment ἀπὸ κοινοῦ. It follows both ‘ in-
ducant animum' and ‘rogati ;' see on
Od. 1. 3. 6.

3. Sardus. See the quotations in
the introd. to this Satire. Its emphatic
position shows that the epithet is meant
to be contumelious.

habebat hoc. Cic. Phil. 2. 32. 78 ‘ha-
bebat hoc omnino Caesar: ‘this was his
way.’ It is a colloquialism, which is
lost if we supply ⁴ vitiu1n.'

4. qui posset, ‘ though he could.'

5. peteret . . . proficeret. Often
referred to as instances of the impft. for
the plpft. subj.: but is it not rather an
instance of the pure hypothetical ‘si
petat . . . proficiat‚⁷ thrown into a
past tense, the force of the subj. being
not to express a doubt, but to generalize ;

‘ if at any time he asked he would gain
nothing'? Cp. the Greek use of ἄν with
the impft. answering to the relative with
the optative, as Soph. Phil. 290 πρὸς δὲ
τοῦθ’, ὅ μοι βάλοι Ι νευροσπαδὴς ἄτρακτος
αὐτὸς ἂν τάλας Ι εἶλυόμην. There is
none of the force of‘ as is tor ‘was') not
the ease ’ which belongs to the regular
use of the impft. or plpft. subj. in con-
ditional sentences In ‘ collibuisset ’
we have the plpst. because the word to
be dealt with was not ‘collibeat’ but
‘ collibuerit‚’ the verb never (as Heindorf
remarks& being found in the present.
See on Sat. 1. 6. 79.
