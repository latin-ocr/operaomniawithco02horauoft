HORATII ARS POETICA.

Aeschylus et modicis instravit pulpita tignis

Et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurno.

280

Successit vetus his comoedia, non sine multa
Laude; sed in vitium libertas excidit et vim
Dignam lege regi; lex est accepta chorusque
Turpiter obticuit sublato iure nocendi.

Nil intemptatum nostri liquere poetae,

Nec minimum meruere decus vestigia Graeca
Ausi deserere et celebrare domestica facta,
Vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas.
Nec virtute foret clarisve potentius armis

Quam lingua Latium, si non offenderet unum
Quemque poetarum limae labor et mora.

Pompilius sanguis, carmen reprehendite quod non

280. magnum loqui: to be taken
closely with the other points in which
he raised the dignity of tragedy ; ‘ lofty
utteranee' went with the dress which
made the actor more splendid, and the
buskin which made him taller than
common life. There is no touch of
ridicule or hostile criticism as in Aris-
tophanes' phrases βρυχώμενος ἥσει
ῥήματα γομφοπαγῆ Ran. 823 and πυρ-
γώσας ῥήματα σεμνά ib. 1004.

281. suecessit . . . his. This, though
not true of the origin of Comedy, for
Susarion was older than Thespis, is true
os its serious development and state-
recognition at Athens. Aristotle re-
marks that its early history is less known
than that os Tragedy διὰ τὸ μὴ σπουδά-
ζεσθαι ἐξ ἀρχῆς Poet. 5. 2. The first
certain record of the acting of comedy
at Athens is of a play of Magnes in 457
B.C.‚ whereas Aeschylus exhibited in 499.
Cratinus (the founder of political
comedy, whom Horace would possibly
look on as the first writer of the ‘ old
comedy,’ cp. Ι. 4. Ι) is said in the
Chron. Euseb. to have exhibited from
454 onward.

283. lex est accepta. We learn
from Scholiasts on Aristophanes (Ach.
67, 1149, Av. 1297l that efforts were
made to restrain by law the licence of
the old comedy by prohibiting the intro-
duction of political personages by name
(μὴ κωμῳδεῖσθαι ὀνομαστί τινα '), but these
seem to have been only temporarily
successful. It was stopped, no doubt,

under the tyranny of the Thirty, and by
the end of the Peloponnesian war a
change of feeling and taste had taken
place which prevented its revival. Cp.
the account, itself perhaps hardly his—
torical, of the restraint of libellous
comedy at Rome, Epp. 2. 1. 147 f.
chorus. The New Comedy had no
chorus, but this was due to other causes
than any law against personal abuse.

288. praetextas . . ‚tog-atas: trage-
dies and comedies in which the charac-
ters were Roman, and wore a Roman
dress, as opposed to ‘crepidatae' and
⁴ palliatae,' which were based on heroic
and Greek life. The form ⁴ praetextae'
instead of ‘ praetextatae ' is found twice
in a letter to Cicero from Asinius Pollio
(ad Fam. 10. 323. ‘ Praetextatae’ were
written by Naevius (‘ Clastidius,’ ‘ Ro-
mulus'), Pacuvius (‘Paulus'), Accius
(‘Aeneadae,' ‘Brutus’t For the ‘to-
gatae' of Afranius cp. Epp. 2. 1. 57 n.

docuere, ‘ exhibited.' aster the Greek
διδάσκειν. So Cic.Tusc. D. 4. 29. 63‘cum
Orestem fabulam doceret Euripides.’

290. unum Quemque. For the di-
vision see on Sat. 1. 9. 51, Epp. 2. 2.
188.

292. Pompilius sanguis: imitated
by Persius 1. 61 ‘ vos o patricius sanguis.’
The nom. sor voc. in solemn address,
Madv. ᾗ 299, obs. 1. Among the sae-
titious genealogies of the time the
Calpumia gens was traced to CalpuS,
a mythical son os Numa, Plutarch Num.
