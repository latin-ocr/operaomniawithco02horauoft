LIB. II. EPIST. 2.

in his sense means (‘lcgitimum‚’ ‘according to the laws of true art') the toil and
fastidious sels-criticism that it involves, he seems to be deseribing, and in glowing
and sympathetic words, the methods and achievements of his friend, whether
recently dead or still alive—the poet Vix-gil. Thcn again an ironical passage.
‘The world sees in such a poet how easily and smoothly his verses flow, and little
thinks os the agony which they have eost the composer. But after all isn't it better
to be able contentedly to write bad verses! But‚' and here finally he becomes
serious, ‘ my true reason is that my mind is full of life and its problems⁸ Is not
vours also? '

The Epistle will naturally be compared—

1. With Epp. I. Ι, which handles the same theme. It will be noticed that
any arguments for a later date for this Epistle, based on its language about the
poet’s advancing years (vv. 55 f.) are answered beforehand by the parallel ¹ solve
senescentem’ of Epp. 1. 1. 8. What 116 says hcre is very greatly an expanding ot
the ‘non eadem est aetas, non mens' of that Epistle. The change lies (1) in the
fuller space given to the arguments against a return to his old pursuit3 which
means probably (as has been said& that the question was for some reason, external
or intemal, becoming a more pressing one to him: (2) in the greater mellowness
aud confidence with which he sets forth the philosophy of 1116 10 which he has
attained.

2. With Epp. 1. 3. It is one of two instances, besides those addressed to
Maecenas, of a second Epistle to the same person; and it is interesting as illus-
trating the reality of the personal element even in the more general Epistles, to
trace the identity of the line taken towards Florus in the two. It is in both, the
young man of letters, to whom Horace speaks naturally and freely on literary
topics, assuming the mutual interest of (ach in the other's pursuits, but to whom
he is disposed to hold up divine philosophy as a better medicine of the soul than
either literature or the ambitions of practica] life.

FLORE, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,

Si quis forte velit puerum tibi vendere natum

Tibure vel Gabiis, 61 16611111 sic agat: ‘Hic et

Candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos

Fiet eritque tuus nummorum milibus octo, 5
Verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus heriles,

1. The address serves to dedicate the
Epistle to Tiberius as well as Florus:
see introd. p. 327.

bono claroque. For the praise of
Tiberius see Epp. 1. 9. 4. It belongs
to the early part of his life, in which
Tacitus describes him as ⁴ egregium vita
famaque quoad privatus vel in imperiis
sub Augusto vixerat' Ann. 6. 51. 5.

3. Tibure vel Gabiis. The vendor
supposed is not a slave-dealer (566 ν, 131,
but a neighbour who ean tell you all
about the boy he 15 sclling.

5. fiet, eritque, an imitation 01 legal
verbiage, as we might say, ‘yours to
have and to hold.'

milibus octo: probably a very mo-
derate price sor a slave of such origin
and capacities; and if so, it 15 part of
the warning which the purchaser re-
ceived that there was a flaw. It is the
sum which Columella 13. gl names as
a 1311· price for a skilled farm labourer
(or vinc-dresscr). Davus in Sat. 2. 7.
43 speaks of himself, but perhaps 111
purposed depreeiaffion, as purchased for
500 drachmae, which would be about
a quarter of this sum.

6. ad. nutus heriles takes the place
of an adj. to ministeriis, ‘services at
a master's beck?
