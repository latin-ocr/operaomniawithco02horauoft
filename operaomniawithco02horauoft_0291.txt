LIB. I. EPIST. 14.

EPISTLE XIV.

To His ‘VILICUS.'

THE Epistle professes to be addressed to his ‘vilicus' or slave-bailiff‚ whom he
had promoted from his town household to the charge of his country house and farm
with its eight slaves (Sat. 2. 7. 1 18), but who hankers still after city life.

Under cover of a comparison between his own tastes and the bailifs's, he justifies
his love of country life (cp. Sat. 2. 6, Epp. 1. 16, εἴα), and preaches his habitual ser-
mon against restlessness and the desire of change.

Verses 1—5. Bailiff of the farm which Ι love and you despise‚ let us See whether my
moralizing is as good as your farming.

6-10. I am longing to get into the country, as much as you to get away from it to
town.

1 1, 12. That on the face of it is folly on both sides.

14—17. There is however this difference, that you change continually, always
disliking what you have. My preference is constant.

18—30. The fact is our tastes are different. What you think unredeemed barrenness,
Ι think beauty. You complain that you miss all the pleasnres of the city, and
yet have constant work.

31. What is the dividing line between us?

32-39. It is true that 1 also loved and became town life, but times have changed,
and Ι have recognized «this. The true inconsistency would have been not to do
so. In the country I am free from envy and ill-will, so busy at my fieldwork
that my neighbours are amused.

40—42. You are seeking to go back to a lot which a city drudge is sharp enough to
see to be much worse than your present one.

43, 44. Ox would wear horse’s trappings, horse do ox's work. My advice is, let
each keep to that which he understands.

1. Vilice. The duties of a ‘vilicus' me feel myself again' Con. Cp. ‘ vivo

are described in Cato, de R. R. 5. 1;
a slave whose heart was iu town plea-
sures would not have satisfied them:
‘ Ne sit ambulator, sobrius siet semper,
ad cenam ne quo eat, familiam exerceat,
consideret quae dominus imperaverit
fiant. Ne plus censeat sapere se quam
dominum‚' etc. Columella 1. 8. 1 warns
a landowner against selecting one whose
accomplishments and tastes are ot' the
city.

agelli: a favourite word with Horace,
sometimes in a depreciatory sense (as
Sat. 1. 6. 71). Here it carries the
double feeling—at once the ‘snug do-
main’ (cp. Sat. 2. 6. 9) as it is to
the poet, and the ‘poor little farm' as
the bailiff contemptuously calls it.

2. habitatum quinque focis. The
Scholiasts all treat ‘habitatum' as a
proper past participle (ί aliquando ⁷ Acr.‚
‘olim' Porph.> and explain it as de—
