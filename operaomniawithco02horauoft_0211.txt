LIB. II. SAT. 8. 199

Orelli, who is in accord with most authorities, arranges the ‘triclinium ’ thus :

imus locus

sive consularis medius summus
Maecenas vibidius ξξζζέᾒῑξ

Maecenas occupied the place of honour. The only departure from usual
practice is that noticed by Horace in v. 23, viz. that Nasidienus put Nomentanus
in his own place next to the chief guest as inore able than himself to do the
honours of the table.

Ι. Ut. In a question, as in Epp. 1.

is addressing his friend Fundanius, Sat.

Nasidieni. For the scansion (cp.
below, vv. 75, 845, the second ‘ i’ being
treated as a ‘ y‚' see Sat. 1. 7. 30 ‘ vin-
demiator.’ In this case it apparently
has the effect, as in Od. 3. 4. 41 ‘ con-
silium‚' 3. 6. 6 ‘ principium,' of lengthen-
ing the preceding vowel, for Martial
7. 54. 11 has ‘ Nasidiene, tibi’ as the
end of a pentameter.

beati, with a tinge of irony, ‘ for-
tune's favourite.’

2. dictus. The omission of ‘ es' is
less common than that of ‘est,' but it
occurs in Virgil, Aen. Ι. 237 ‘pollicitus,'
5. 687 ‘exosus,’ 10. 827 ‘ laetatus' There
and here some editors would write ‘ pol-
licitu's‚' ‘ dictu’s,' etc.

3. de medio die: cp. Epp. 1. 14. 34
‘media de luce '; not ‘ from noon‚’ but
as ‘de nocte' Epp. 1. 2. 32, ‘media
de noete' Epp. 1. 7. 88, ‘before the

period of midday is over ’ς see note on
‘de die' Epod. 13. 4. The reference
is to what Cicero calls ⁴ tempestivum
conviviu1n,' a banquet which begins be-
fore the usual hour; see on Epp. 1. 7. 71.

4. fuerit melius, ‘I enjoyed myselfsp [χρηεν

die. There is some· doubt between
this reading and ‘da.’ The weight of
MSS. (including all of Cruq.) is for
‘die.' The Comm. Cruq. read and
interpreted ‘da.' Bentley thinks it an
emendation of a copyist who remem-
bered Virg. E. I. 19 ‘iste deus qui sit,
da, Tityre, nobis.y Orelli gives ‘da‚’
and Keller argues for it.

5. placaverit: cp. Sat. 2. 2. 18
‘ Latrantem stomachum bene leniet.’

6. Lucanus: Sat. 2. 3. 234.

leni Austro: see Sat. 2. 2. 41. The
point apparently is the vulgarity of the
host in discoursing on the dishes pre-
sented, and his affectation of gastro-
nomic precision. The boat was from
