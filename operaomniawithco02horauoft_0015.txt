TO THE SATIRES. 3
has lasted a little while. Horace looks back on its stages (6. 54-62) z
it has stood some tests (3. 63—65); people are still curious about it,
and yet some are already seeking to profit by it (5 and 9). Now is
we can date Sat. 2. 6, Horace gives us in it the means of also <lating
approximately the commencement of his close relations to Maecenas 1
for in v. 40 he says—
‘Septimus octavo propior iam fugerit annus

Ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere suorum
In numero.’ (With the last words cp. Sat. Ι. 6. 62.)

The expression is not perfectly clear, but this probably means ‘It is
seven or rather very nearly eight full years since‚' etc. There is also
the doubt, which always attaches to Roman reckoning, whether this
is to be taken exclusively or inclusively, to mean what we should also
call ‘ seven years verging on eight‚’ or what we should rather call ‘six
verging on seven.' The date of the Satire itself can be fixed within a
few months, but not more closely. Three indications of time are
given in it. (1) In v. 38 the words ‘Imprimat his, cura, Maecenas signa
tabellis ' seem to refer to the time of the ‘bellum Actiacum⁷ and the
' following events, during which Maecenas (in conjunction later with
Agrippa) had the charge of affairs in Rome and Italy for Octavianus
and bore his signet ring ¹. (2) In v. 53 Horace represents as one
of the questions put to him by persons who credited him with know-
ing state secrets, ‘ numquid de Dacis audisti?' The Daci are men—
tioned by Dion as offering their services to Octavianus before the
battle of Actium, and, on his declining them, to Antony2: and it
is evident that they continued to be a cause of some anxiety at
Rome, for he speaks of Crassus being sent against them in ΒΕ. 3ο.
(3) In v. 55 another question asked of him is, ‘militibus promissa
Triquetra Praedia Caesar an est Itala tellure daturus?' The allo-
cation referred to is probably that after Actium, and the moment at
which this question would be most in men's mouths would be
in the winter of B.c. 31, when Dion reports that so serious a mutiny
broke out among the disbanded soldiers, who feared they were to
be disappointed of their rewards, that Octavianus had to pay a
hasty visit to Italy and provide for the assigmnent of lands to them ³².

Of these dates (1) would suit any time from the middle of B.C. 31
to the return of Octavianus to Rome in 29 : (2) would be, so far as
we know, best satisfied in B.c. 31 or 30: (3) points most definitely
to the winter of B.c. 31, though the form of reference does not ex·
