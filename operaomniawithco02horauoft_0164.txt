HORATII SATIRARUM

Et furiosus erit; quern cepit vitrea fama,
Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis.
Nunc age luxuriam et Nomentanum arripe mecum:

Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes.

225

Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,

Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,
Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum,

Mane domum veniant.

222. vitrea, ‘ with her glitter.’ This
is more likely than the other alternative
offered by the Schol. ‘ vel fragilis.⁷

223. circumtonuit, has made him
ε’μβρόντητος. For the worship of Bel-
lona and the frenzy inspired by it see
Mayor's note on Juv. S. 4. 123 ‘ ut fana-
ticus oestro Percussus, Bellona, tuo,'
which explains ‘ gaudens cruentis.' His
votaries gashed themselves, like the
priests of Baal (⁶ quos sectis Bellona
lacertis Saeva movet' Lucan. 1. 565).
‘ The votary of farne has caught a frenzy
which, like that of Bellona, leads to
cruel and bloody acts) It should be
remembered that this picture of ambi-
tion is drawn by oue who had lived
through the proscriptions and other
horrors of the civil wars. For a some—
what similar comparison of the effects
of passion and of the frenzy of inspira-
tion ep. Od. 1. 16. 5—9.

224—280. Stertinius proceeds to ar-
raign as madmen the extravagant3 the
description narrowing itself presently to
one special form and cause of extrava-
gance, viz. ⁴ meretricum amores?

arripe : see on Sat. 2. 1. 69.

225. vincet ratio: Sat. 1. 3. 115
(with ‘ut' and subjst, see note there.
Cp. ‘evincet ³ below, v. 250.

stultos, closely with ‘ insanire'; corne
under the class of ⁶ stulti‚' and therefore
are mad.

226. hic: not necessarily Nomenta-
nus, which, as we have seen lon v. 175l,
is a conventional name, but δεικτικῶς, a
specimen of the class.

simul=‘simul ac,’ Od. 1. 12. 27, 3.
4- 37-

227. edicit, issues his notices, in
lordly style; an official word belonging
to consuls, praetors, tribunes. Cp. Sat.
2. 2. 51, Epp.1.19.10.

piscator, auceps, ‘dealers in fish

Quid tum? Venere frequentes.

230

and game ‘ ς but, as it seems from v. 234,
their procurers also. The requirements
are all for a banquet.

228. 'I'usei vici, a street leading
from the Forum Romanum into the
Velabrum. It was a street of shops.
In the satirical list of spots of bad re-
pute in Rome (Haut. Cure. 4. 1. 21} its
characteristic is that ‘ibi sunt homines
qui ipsi se venditant! It was afterwards
called the ⁶ vicus Turarius,' and is very
probably the street ‘vendentem tus et
odores,5 etc. of Epp. 2. 1. 269. Cp. also
Epp. 1. 20. 1 n. See Bum’s Rome and
Campagna, p. 277.

229. fartor: variously explained as
‘poulterer,’ ‘sausage seller‚' or ‘ profes-
sional cook.' The last, which is given
by the Pseudo-Acron, would suit the po-
sition of the word best. If he were con-
cerned with the purveying of the provi-
sions we do not see why he should come
by himself aster the ‘scurrae.’ With
this interpretation there is some point in
coupling the seasoner of the dishes and
the seasoners of the talk.

Velabro, in the low ground be—
tween the Capitoline, the Palatine, and
the river. Plautus l. c. describes its
trades, ‘In Velabro vel pistorem, vel
lanium vel aruspicem, Vel qui ipsi
vortant, vel qui alii subvorsentur prae-
beant.’ The Comm. Cruq. says ‘ In
Velabro prostabant omnia quae ad victus
rationem et delicias pertinebant!

macellum. Ter. Eun. 2. 2. 24 ‘ ad
macellum ubi adventamus, Concurrunt
laeti ini obviam cupedinarii omnes ; Ce-
tarii, lanii, coqui, sartores, piscatores,
aucupes, Quibus et re salva et perdita
profueram et prosum saepe.'

230. venere frequentes: the anti-
thesis is ‘they came in numbers, one
was the spokesman.’
