LIB. ΙΙ.

SAT. 3. 151

Permixtas capiet, commotus habebitur, atque

Stultitiane erret nihilum distabit an ira.

210!

Aiax immeritos cum occidit desipit agnos:

Cum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanes,

Stas animo, et purum est vitio tibi, cum tumidum est, cor?
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agnam,

Huic vestem, ut gnatae, paret ancillas, paret aurum,

Rufam aut Posillam appellet fortique marito
Destinet uxorem; interdicto huic omne adimat ius
Praetor, et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos
Quid? si quis gnatam pro muta devovet agna

Integer est animi? Ne dixeris.
Stultitia, hic summa est insania;

varianee with true ones,' the abl. after
‘alias,’ as ‘alium sapiente bonoque '
Epp. 1. 16. 20, ete. For ‘ tumultu‚'
whether taken by itself or <as with this
last reading) with ‘scele1·is,’ compare
Od. 2. 16. 10 ‘miseros tumultus rnen-
tis.' In any case the general meaning
is that a confusion of moral ideas, how-
ever caused, is a sign of madness. This
is most pointedly expressed <if the Latin
will bear the sense) by the reading which
makes ‘veri scelerisque' answer to one
another. It is not the falsity of Agamem-
non’s ideas, but the confusion in them
of good ends and bad means, which is
stigmatized.

209. commotus, as below, v. 278.
Pliny has ‘ mentes commotas’ N. H. 36.
40. 21, ‘ upset,' ‘unhingeds Cp. the use
of ‘ concussa’ below, v. 295.

210. nihilum, adverbially‚ as above,
v. 54.

211. desipit, ‘ has lost his wits.'
For the position of this word see on
Sat. 2. 1. 60 ‘ Quisquis erit vitae, scribam,
color.'

212. prudens, Agamemnon's own
word, v. 206.

ob titulos inanes. For ⁶ titulos' cp.
Od. 4. 14. 4, honorary inscriptions on
monuments, etc. For the use of Roman
phrases of Agamemnon see on v. 192 ;
but in these last lines it is more con-
tinuous, and indicates that the allegory
is being lost in the application.

213. vitio, in its more general sense,
‘ flaw.’

tumidum: cp. Epp. 1. 1. 36 ‘ Laudis
amore tumes.’

cor ε the seat here both of intelligence

Ergo ubi prava
qui sceleratus,

ζ as in Lucret. 4. 53 ‘ hebeti cognoscere
corde ³) and of passion. Horace secans,
though he does not use, the word ‘ ve-
cordia,' of madness.

216. Rufarn aut Posillam, as Bent-
ley notices, common female names (so
found in inscriptions), not pet names.
The madman is supposed to treat a lamb
as a girl, just as Agamemnon had treated
a girl as a lamb.

217. interdicto. Horace alludes in
Epp. 1. 1. 102 4‘ Nec medici credis nec
curatoris egere A praetore dati 'l to the
same legal process of depriving an in-
sane person by the Praetor's ‘inter-
dictum ⁹ of the control of his property,
and putting him under the guardian-
ship (‘tutela' or ‘curatio ') of rela-
tlons.

220. integer animi: see above, v. 61
‘ integer mentis.’

ne dixeris, ‘ Do not say so.' With
these words Agamemnon is finally dis-
missed, and the general conclusion of
his story is drawn, ‘ Ergo‚' ete. For the
quantity of ‘dixeris ' see on Sat. 2. 2.

prava: which makes a man go
wrong.

220—223. Not three types or grades
of madness‚ but three modes of describ-
ing such acts as those of Agamemnon
(and, it is suggested, of all men of am-
bition). From each point of view the
sentence os madness in the highest de—
gree is affixed to them. The climax is
attained by putting last the motive,
the desire for farne, as in itself, apart
from acts, the proof and result of
frenzy.
