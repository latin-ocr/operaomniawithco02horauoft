308 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Propugnat nugis armatus:

‘ Scilicet ut non

Sit mihi prima fides, et vere quod placet ut non

Acriter elatrem! Pretium aetas altera sordet.'

Ambigitur quid enim? Castor sciat an Dolichos plus;
Brundisium Minuci melius via ducat an Appi. 20

de lana caprina: a proverbial expres-
sion sor an absurd subject os argument, as
the Greek περὶ ὄνου σκιᾶς μάχεσθαι, but
the source of the proverb is not known.
The Scholiasts agree that it is a proverb,
but give various explanations. ‘ Some-
thing valueless‚’—but goats’ hair was not
valueless; ‘something nonexistent‚’—a
colour is given to this by the fact that
one of Livy's prodigies is the birth of
a ‘ capra lanata.' Porph. gives an
altemative suggestion that the question
fought over was the name, whether
goats' hair could properly be called
¹ lana.'

16. propugnat nugis armatus, ‘does
battle sor trifles in full armour.' It has
been questioned whether ‘ nugis ’ is to be
taken as abl. with ‘ armatus‚’or with ‘pro-
pugnat' [either as a dative, ace. to the
use in later Latin, or as an abl. as though
it were ‘ pugnat pro nugis ’). There ean
be little doubt the latter is right. The
illustrations given in the following lines
are not tas they should be if ‘nugis
armatus ' were the last words left on our
ears) of futile arguments employed, but
of the spirit of the strife, the triviality
of subject being supposed. It is the
emphasis on ‘ propugnat ⁷ and ‘ armatus,’
substituted sor the tame ‘rixatur‚' which
forms the climax and justifies the asyn-
deton between vv. 15, 16; ‘nugis'
merely repeats the ⁴ de lana caprina ⁷ of
the line before in a less emphatic form,
the emphasis being laid here on the
spirit not the occasion of the fight.

scilieet ut non sit. The same
constr. as Sat. 2. 5. 18 ‘ utne tegam3’
Madv. ᾗ 358 obs. ‘Scilicet' adds irony
to the indignant question. Note that,
though not in this particular use,
‘scilicet ut' is a frequent combination.
Some editors, with less force, sub-
stitute a comma for a question at
‘elatrem‚' and construet ‘ut sit' ‘ut
elatrem’ after ‘pretiu1n,' ‘is a mean
price sor my not being trusted,' etc.

18. elatrem: as we say of unre-
strained speech, ‘ openmouthed.’

aetas altera: cp. ‘ter aevo functus'
Od. 2. 9. 135 ‘ life a second time over';

εἷ κέν μοι ὑποσταίη θεὸς αὐτὸς 1 ’γῆρας
ἀποξύσας θήσειν νέον ἡβώοντα Hom.

199. 4ski251at plus, ‘has the more skill ';
the phrase suits the view that the pair
are gladiators, better than that they are
actors. The Scholiasts offer the two
alternatives.

Dolichos. Ι follow Munro in re-
taining what became after Cruquius the
usual text, though the evidence for it is
not convincing. All Keller‘s good MSS.
except ε (the Einsiedeln MS.) have
‘ Docilis,’ and this is found in the text
of all scholia. ‘3 of the Bland' (this
probably does not mean V) had, as
ε has, ‘Dolicis,' and Cruquius found
‘ Dolichos' in three others of his MSS
The Greek name (50A1X65=‘longus’) is
rather the more likely' in its elf; and if
we believe Cruquius' testimony as to the
reading of his MSS. (Keller, as usual,
doubts him), ‘Dolichos’ seems more
likely to have been the original text
than an emendation.

20. Minuci via. This cannot be
identified with any certainty. The only
other mention of a ‘via Minucia’ is in
Cic. ad Att. 9. 6, where he describes
six cohorts as moving by it from Alba
to join Vibius Curius, Caesar's partisan.
lf this is the Alba by the Lacus Fucinus,
as is generally thought, the ‘via Mi-
nucia' would se'em to be a part of the
‘ via Valeria‚' which led across the Ap-
pennines from Tibur by Alba Fucentia
and Corfinium to the Adriatic at the
mouth of the Aternus. It would here
strike into the coast road, and so a
traveller might reach Brundisium; but
the route is a strange one to take from
Rome to that port. Mr. Bunbury
(Dict. Geog. 2. p. 1289 al suggests
that Horace's ‘via Minucia' vsas the
road from Beneventum through Canu
sium to Brundisium, which Strabo de-
scribes as an alternative to the ‘via
Appia' proper, which went round by
Tarentum tsee introd. to Sat. 1. 5).
This would suit the present passage
perfectly, but there is no further evi-
dence in its favour.
