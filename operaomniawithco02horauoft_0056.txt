44 HORATII SATIRARUM

Aut positum ante mea quia pullum in parte catini
Sustulit esuriens, minus hoc iucundus amicus

Sit mihi? Quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si

Prodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarit? 95
Quis paria esse fere placuit peccata, laborant

Cum ventum ad verum est3 sensus moresque repugnant
Atque ipsa utilitas, iusti prope mater et aequi.

Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,

nitely to earlier authorities, ‘qui de per-
sonis Horatianis scripserunt aiunt‚' etc.
The identification was natural and tempt-
ing to those to whom the name ovaander
was familiar as th at ofa worker in bronze ;
but it does not follow that it is right.
There is some difficulty as to date. Evan-
deris not said to have come to Rome till
aster the capture of Alexandria in B.C.
30, when he was brought among the
captives, The parallels quoted make
strongly for the other interpretation.
Martial's ‘Pylio pollice trita' is very
possibly an echo of this place. 1f we
adopted the Scholiast's explanation we
must take ‘ tritum ’ as = ‘tornatum '
(Virg. G. 2. 444 ‘radios trivere rotis')‚
but with an extension of meaning similar
to that with which Virgil uses ‘ tomus’
in Ecl. 3. 38 of the instmment with
which a wooden cup was ornamented
with the vine and ivy. The ‘ catillus' is
doubtless of metal, which might be
(lintcd by a fall, not earthenware which
would be destroyed.

92. ante. Itis doubtful whether this
is to be taken with ‘positum,’ as a
tmesis, ‘anteponere' having its sense,
frequentin Plautus, of‘ to set before,’ ‘ to
place on table’;—Cicero uses ‘ponit
ante’ (but for the purpose os emphasis)
for ‘anteponit' in Off. 3. 17. 71;—or
(as Ritter‘· with ‘ sustulit‚' ‘ has snatched
first—before me.’ There is the same
uncertainty in Tibull. 1. 1. 13 ‘ Et quod-
cunque mihi pomum novus educat
gnmis’ Libatum agricolae ponitur ante

e0.

95. fide : arehaic form of dative.
See on Od. 3. 7. 4.

sponsum negarit, ‘has denied a
pledge ; ' said that the pledge which has
been given has not been given. ‘ Spon-
dere’ is the legal term covering many
kinds os engagements.

96. quis, ‘ quibus,' i. e. the Stoics. Cp.
Cic. de Fin. 4. 19. 55, a passage which

the resemblance of expression makes it
probablethat Horace had in mind. ‘Recte
sacta omnia aequalia,omniapeccata paria
esse: quae cum magnifice primo dicivide-
rentur, considerata minus probabantur:
sensus enim cuiusque et natura rerum at-
que ipsa veritas clamat quodammodo
non posse adduci ut inter eas res quas
Zeno exaequaret nihil interesset.'

fere with ‘ paria,' ‘ much on a level.'
He takes the general tendeney of the
Stoic doctrine, guarding himself against
the answer that they admitted certain
differences. Compare other instances
in which a qualisying particle is added
to the enunciation of broad doctrines,
‘ fere’ Epp. Ι. 6. 9, ‘prope' Sat. 1. 3.
98, 2. 3. 32-

laborant: ἀποροῦσι.

97. Horace appeals against the Stoic
dogma first to the moral feelings (‘sensus
moresque 'l of mankind ; secondly to
public utility. This, he says (following
the Epicurean doctrine), is the highest
source of our distinction of social right
and wrong: and it is evident that offences
are not all equal as judged by that
standard. If right and wrong were a dis-
tinction of nature sels-evident, the Stoics
might have more to say for themselves.
His view of the utilitarian origin of all
law he supports by a sketch ofthe origin
of society based both in substance and
expression on Lucret. 5. 92 5 foll.

98. iusti et aequi: the double expres-
sion means justice of all kinds and de·
grees, in rule and in sentiment.

99. prorepserunt . . . animalia.
Though speaking of the human race he
purposely‚ in describing their first state
of savagery, uses ternis which apply to
them in common with the animal world.

primjs terris, as ‘ prima tellus' Sat.
2. 2. 93. He is thinking of the mode
of generation described in Lucret. 5. 803
soll.
