HORATII ARS POETICA.

Nomen iambeis‚ cum senos redderet ictus

Primus ad extremum similis sibi.
Tardior ut paulo graviorque veniret ad aures,

Non ita pridem,
255

Spondeos stabiles in iura paterna recepit
Commodus et patiens non ut de sede secunda

Cederet aut quarta socialiter.

Hic et in Acci

Nobilibus trimetris apparet rarus, et Enni

In scenam missos cum magno pondere versus

260

Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis
Aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.
Non quivis videt immodulata poemata iudex,
Et data Romanis venia est indigna poetis.

Idcircone vager scribamque licenter? an omnes

2⁶5

Visuros peccata putem mea, tutus et intra
Spem veniae cautus? Vitavi denique culpam,

Non laudem merui.

but ‘since,' the chief emphasis being
not on ‘senos,’ but on ‘primus ad
extremum similis.' They were called
trimeters because though there were six
feet they were all ‘iambil ‘ Iambeis'
is probably (as Ritter pointed out) a
neut. subst.‚ ἰαμβεῖον being the Greek
name for an iambic verse (Arist. Ran.
1 133, 1204, etc.); ‘bade the name of tri—
meters gather to the iambic verses.’ For
the imitation of the Greek form cp.
· Argeo¹ Od. 2. 6. 5.

254. 1 take this not as Prof. Nettle-
ship <Essays in Lat. Lit. p. 180) as a
proof that Horace is quoting from a
writer on metre who lived near the time
of the change, but as an evidently
hyperbolical way of saying that the idea
of the metre was iambic, and that the
admission of ‘ spondees’ was an after·
thought. ‘ 'Tis only the other day that,’
etc. There is an affectation oscarelessness
in the whole passage. He is contrasting
(as Prof. Nettleship points out) the
tragic senarius with that of Archilochus.
Yet this latter, as ancient writers on
metre say, and as the extant fragments
of his poem< prove, admitted ‘ spondees‚'
though less frequently than the tragic
verse. Horace himself in Epod. 16
wrote pure Iambics, as Catullus had in
two poems, and probably they had some
Greek precedents: but the picture of
an age of pure Iambics is a playsul
exaggeration.

not mention the sixth place because even
Roman writers respected the rule there.

hie, se. ‘iambus’3 the metaphor is
hardly lost yet. He is a rare sight in
his own home.

his admirers. See on Epp. 2. 1. 50.

tive of the verses described.

261, 262. The two faults of which he
offers the choice are the two which it is
the special object of the Ars Poetica to
forestall by pressing on Roman poets
the necessity of patient work (cp. vv.
293 f.‚ Sat. 1. 10. 72, Epp. 2. 1. 167)
and of systematic art. ἔκ See esp. vv.
379-382, 4ο8-415..

263. A concess1on. ‘I allow that
the public ear is obtuse and the result
has been an unworthy licence in our

oets.’

p 265-269. ‘What then is to be my
conclusion. Shall I follow my own
caprice? or shall I credit the public
with sharper eyes than they have and
then keep safe from their criticism Ῥ
That can lead at best to a negative
excellence. The true method is to steep
yourself in Greek models.'
