‘Tene magis salvum populus velit an populum tu,

Servet in ambiguo qui consulit et tibi et urbi

Iuppiter‚' Augusti laudes agnoscere possis:

Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari, 30
Respondesne tuo, dic sodes, nomine? ‘Nempe

Vir bonus et prudens dici delector ego ac tu.'

Qui dedit hoc hodie cras, si volet, auferet, ut si

Detulerit fasces indigno, detrahet idem.

‘Pone‚ meum est:' inquit.

Pono tristisque recedo. 35

Idem si clamet furem, neget esse pudicum,

27. The Scholiasts tell us that this is
a quotation from the ‘Panegyricus in
Caesarem Augustum’ of the poet Varius;
see on Od. 1. 6. 1. It will be noticed
how skilfully Horace introduces hythe
way, in a letter which is to be published‚
a compliment to Augustus.

30. pateris sapiens vocari ; for constr.
see on Epp. 1. 5. 15.

sapiens emendatusque: ‘ the flaw-
less wise man ’ 3 the ‘ que ' is due only to
the Latin usage, which does not generally
allow adjectives to be accumulated with-
out a copulative conjunction. Madv. ξ
300, obs. 5.

31. respondesne tuo nomine.
‘ When you allow yourself to be called
so, do you virtually claim the title? '
This must be the sense. The phrase is
possibly suggested from the ‘ respondere
ad nomina’ of a Roman levy tLiv. 3.
41, etc.). Isso, the technical phrase is
slightly varied according to Horace’s
wont <see on Od. 2. 4. 24, etc.). But
‘respondere vocatus' is a recognized
phrase, with no such special references
<see Cic. de Or. 3. 49. 191) and ‘tuo
nomine,' ‘ on your account‚' ‘ as though
the name belonged to you,’ may be an
addition modelled on such phrases as
‘mihi tuo nomine gratulabantur’ Cic.
Phil. 1. 12. 30. This is one of the in-
stances sometimes alleged of ‘ne' for
‘ nonne ’ς i. e. where the answer expected
is ‘yes’3 but see on Epp. 1. 17. 38.
There is here, as there, an ironical effect
in the more indefinite form of interroga-
tion. For ‘sodes' see Sat. 1. 9. 41,
Epp. 1. Ι. 62.

nempe, a supposed reply, assenting,
but putting the statement in a way that
explains and justifies it, and with a touch
of irony.

32. vir bonus et prudens seems a

synonym for the ‘vir bonus et sapiens '
ofv. 73 3 cp. Epp. 1. 7. 22 with A. P. 445.

dici delector: to be added to the
instanees of the extended use of the com-
plementary infinitive in Append. 2 to
vol. 1.

ego ac tu, ‘ Ι as well as y0u.’ We are
all alike in this respect.

33. qui, sc. ‘ populus.’ This is
Horace’s rejoinder. ‘Those who give
can take away.' He has perhaps in view
the paradox in which the Stoic elothed
his assertion of the inalienable dignity of
virtue, ‘the wise man is always king,’
and the Roman version which he so
often gives to it, ‘the wise man holds an
office not bestowed or taken away “ ar-
bitrio popularis aurae'’ ’; see on Od. 3. 2.
17, 4. 9. 39. Orelli is also doubtless
right in suggesting that Horace has in
mind Lucr. 3. 995 ‘ Sisyphus in vita
quoque nobis ante oculos est, Qui
petere a populo fasces saevasque secures
Imbibit et semper victus tristisque
recedit?

34. detrahet z a comparison ode. 3.
2. 17 shows that we need not ask with
some editors whether Horace is referring
to that rarely exercised power of ‘ abro-
gatio imperii.' He is speaking popu·
larly, and ¹ detrahet' is sufficiently
explained of his being rejected for
the next office sought or even of not
being elected at all. Cp. Epp. 1. 6. 55
‘ eripietque curule Cui volet importunus
ebur!

35. pone, meum est : ‘ pone '= ⁴ de-
pone.’ Bentley pointed out that the
object is not ‘ fasces‚‘ which would raise
difficulties as to ‘meum‚' but the same
as ‘hoc’ of v. 33, viz. the name of
‘ good and wise.'

36. ‘If it was to go further, and not
only refuse a good name but give a bad
