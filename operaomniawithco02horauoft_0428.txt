HORATII ARs POETICA.

Effutire leves indigna Tragoedia versus,

Ut festis matrona moveri iussa diebus,
Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda protervis.
Non ego inornata et dominantia nomina solum

Verbaque, Pisones, Satyrorum scriptor amabo;

235

Nec sic enitar tragico differre colori,

Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et audax
Pythias emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque dei Silenus alumni.

Ex noto fictum carmen sequar, ut sibi quivis

Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret

treme is apt to lead into the other; see
above v. 31.

231 f. Tragedy, so grave and stately in
all she does, will find herself a little un-
comfortable among saucy satyrs, and
therefore the satyrs must not be too
saucy.

2 32. moveri, ‘to dance‚' as in Epp.
2. 2. 125. ‘Sunt enim quaedam sacra
in quibus saltant matronae, sicut in sacris
Matris deum’ Acr.; see Od. 2. 12 introd.
and v. 17.

2 34. dominantia seems a transla-
tion of κύρια, the Greek term for ordinary
words in their usual forms and accepta-
tion : Arist. Poet. 21. 2. The usual
Latin phrase was ‘propria.'

nomjna verbaque ε
103 n.

235. Satyrorum scriptor, ‘ if 1 come
to write Satyric dramas.’ The Greeks
used Σάτυροι 111 the same sense. For
‘ scriptor ' see above on v. 120.

2 36. colori ε above v. 86 n. For
dat. see on Epp. 2. 1. 4.

2 37. Davus, a slave of comedy; cp.
Sat. 2. 5. 91, etc.

et, the reading necessary to the sense,

Sat. 1. 3.

is given by B and was in V, the other
good MSS. having ‘ an.'

2 38. Pythias: acharacter, according
to the Scholiasts, in a play of ‘ Lucilius.’
This has been generally considered a
mis-writing for Caecilius. emuncto,
in the sense of ‘cheatedj is a comic
word, and very possibly comes from the
passage Horace is recalling. If Bentley’s
conjecture (on A. P. 96) of ‘ emunxeris ’
might stand in the fragment of Caecilius
quoted by Cicero de Am. 26. 99 (cp. de
Sen. 11. 39 ‘ut me hodie ante omnes
comicos senes Versaris atque emunxeris
lautissime ')‚ we should have probably

what we are in search of ; but it is only
a conjecture.

2 39. Silenus, the father of the Satyrs
and the nurse and παιδαγωγός t‘ custos,’
see on Sat. 1. 6. 81) of the ever youthsul
Bacchus3 conceived at once as a jovial
drunken old man and as a prophet
(Virg Ecl. 6. 31 f.) and philosopher
(Cic. Tusc. D. 1. 48. 114): he was the
representative of wisdom concealed
under uncouth and unlikely exterior,
whence Socrates was likened to him,
Plat. Sympos. p. 215, Diet. Biog. s. v.
Silenus.

240. ex noto fictum. Is Horace
still speaking of the diction of a Satyric
drama? So Acr.‚ followed by Orelli
and other editors, on the ground that
otherwise he is made to pass from dic-
tion to plot and back again to diction in
v. 244. But ‘ fingere carmen ex ' is most
naturally interpreted of the plot, and if
these verses really referred to the dic-
tion, we should have in v. 244 some
conjunction to indicate that the precept
there given was a limitation of what
preceded. That passage stands, as this
one does, without a conjunction, be-
cause they are both independent of the
lines before them. Ritter seems rightly
to indicate what differences vv. 244 f.
from vv. 225—239. See on v. 244. The
difficulty of connection has seemed so
great to some editors that they have
thought vv. 240—243 to be out of their
place. Ribbeck omits them3 but they
are in Horace’s best style.

sequar: Epp. 1. 2. 143; ‘it will be
my aim.'

241. Cp. Byron’s imitation (Hints
from Horace)

Whom nature guides, so writes that

every dunce
