HORATII ARS POETICA.

Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum,

Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper

Incolumi gravitate iocum tentavit, eo quod

Illecebris erat et grata novitate morandus

Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces 225
Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria ludo,

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,

Regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,

Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,

Aut, dum vitat humum, nubes et inania captet.

220450. Horace passes to the Satyrie
drama, which, he points out, was from
the beginning nearly connected with
tragedy‚ and must not be lowered to
the level of comedy. He is keeping to
his previous course in treating of it as on
-the Greek stage, and not drawing any
marked line between that and the
Roman usage; but it is impossible to
give his words their natural meaning
without supposing that he contemplates
the Satyric drama as a practicable form
of Latin literature. Porphyrion (on v.
221) asserts that Pomponius (that is,
probably, if his words are meant to
explain what Horace had in mind,
Pomponius Bononiensis. the writer of
Atellanae ; see Macrob. Sat. 1. 10) wrote
Satyric plays, naming three, Atalanta,
Sisyphus, and Ariadne. Prof. Nettle-
ship (Essays in Latin Literature, p. 179),
without definitely acceptingPorphyrion's
statement, has pointed out that Diomedes
the grammarian (p. 490) recognizes the
⁶ Graeca Satyrica’ as a form of Latin
play holding towards the ‘ Atellana ² the
same relation as a ‘tragoedia’ of Pa-
cuvius, in which heroic personages ap-
pear, to a ‘praetextata‚' in which the
characters are historical and Roman.

220. vilem, ‘the cheap prize⁷; the
epithet implies ‘in those primitive
and simple times.' For the fact cp. the
inscription on the Parian Marble, 43
[ἑ]τε’θη ὁ τράγος [ἆθλον] ; see Bentley’s
Phalaris xi. Horace is no doubt follow-
ing the etymology commonly given in
antiquity to τραγῳδία, but his object is
to link the origin of the satyric drama
with that of tragedy. This is done as
effectually by the more recent view that
it was called the ‘goat song’ from the
chorus of goats or satyrs.

221. mox need involve no contradic-
tion of Aristotle's statement (Poet. 4.
14) that tragedy itself was originally
σατυρικὴ καῖ ὀρχηστικωτέρα, even if it
refers to the chronological relations of
tragedy and the satyrio drama, for
Horace might well have in view the
separate existence of the latter, which
dates from Pratinas, πρῶτος ἔγραψε
Σατύρους z but it is equally probable that
as‘mox‚' as ‘nuper ' in v. 228, refers to
relations between the tragedies and the
satyric play at a given performance‚ the
very poet who had been exhibiting a
tragedy, ‘presently,' on the same boards,
exhibited a satyric drama.

nudavit, i. e. brought Satyrs naked
on the stage.

222. ineolumi gravitate, ‘without
sacrificing dignity ’—-to be taken closely
with asper. It matters not whether
we say ‘his own dignity ' or ‘ that of the
characters‚⁷ sor he is spoken of through-
out as doing that which he makes his
characters do.

224. potus. Wilkins quotes Plat.
Legg. 6. p. 775 πίνειν δὲ εἷς μέθην οὔτε
ἄλλοθί που πρέπει πλὴν ἐν ταῖς τοῦ τὸν
οἶνον δόντος θεοῦ ἑορταῖς,

225. ita . . ‚itam . . ita . . . ne, ‘with
this reservation that . . . not,’ etc.; see
on v. 151.

risores . . . dicaces, of mere fun,

and of edged sayings. For ‘risores‘
see on ‘scriptor’ v. 120.
226. vertere seria ludo, ‘ to change
grave to gay' ; ‘vertere' with the
construction of ‘ mutare ' ; see on Od. 1.
1 . 2.
7228. nuper, i. e. in the tragedy just
exhibitcd.

doctrine, that the avoidance of one ex-
