SAT. 10.

109

Ι, puer, atque meo citus haec subscribe libello.

desidet, atque aliqua. semper in aure
soriliitlieo plorare, κλαίειν κελεύω, a
form of contemptuous dismissa1; but
perhaps also with a play on the words
in reference to the whining tone of the
poetry which they admire3 see on
V913 This verse is no doubt rightly
taken by Bentley (Praef.) as an epilogue
to the first book of the Satires. See

Introduction, p. 1. For the use of
‘libellus' compare the extract from
Augustus’ letter vol. 1, p. xxviii,
‘ Pertulit ad me Dionysius libellum
tuum.’ Horace imagines himself de-
livering the Satire to his copying slave
(‘librarius’) to add to the roll just
eompleted of the other nine. It has been
also taken, less probably, of the addition
of the last taunt as an afterthought to
this particular Satire ; so Heindorf.
