SATIRE III.

DAMASIPPUS, OR A MAD WORLD.

THE Satire is based on the Stoic paradox that every one but the wise man is
mad (ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται, see Cicero’s 4th Paradox), which Horace treats aster
his wont, laughing with others at it, but using it as a weapon with which, without
departing from his habitual irony, he can strike at practical follies.

The bulk of the Satire is put into the mouth of Stertinius, a lecturer of the day
(like Crispinus of Book Ι), whom in Epp. 1. 12. 20 Horace, makes, but in a ban-
tering tone, the representative of Stoic philosophy. He is otherwise unknown to us.
The Scholiasts say his works filled 220 volumes.

Damasippus (like Trebatius in Sat. 2. 1) is a character· in Cicero’s Epistles‚ in
which he appears as a elever go—between in· the purchase of estates and works of
art (Cic. ad Att. 12. 29 and 33, ad Fam. 7. 233 ep. vv. 20-26 of this Satire).
Horace represents him [whether with any historical foundation or not, we cannot
say) as having been ruined and on the point of suicide. Stertinius meets him on
the Pons Fabricius and saves him from this folly by preaching to him the Stoic
doctrine that all men save the true philosopher are mad alike—he need not be
ashamed ; let his missortunes be as ridiculous and his conduct as foolish as possible,
he has all the world as companions in his folly. This is set out at length in a
discourse which, as is usual with Horace, loses after a time its vital connection
with the scene. The dramatic tone is resumed at v. 296, and Horace ends the
Satire by good-humouredly turning the laugh against himself.

This Satire should be compared throughout with Sat. 2. 7, which deals in a
similar way with another Paradox.

Verses 1—16. Damasippus rallies Horace for his fastidiousness and laziness in eom—
position.

16-18. ‘ Excellent advice‚’ says Horace, ‘ my philosopher. How do you know me
so well 'P ’
