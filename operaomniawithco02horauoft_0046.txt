34 HORATII SATIRARUM ¹

SATIRE III.

SATIRE IS ONE THING, PERSONAL CENSORIOUSNESS ς
ANOTHER.

HORACE begins with a satirical picture of Tigellius as the type of a character

made up of contradictions and inconsisteneies (vv. 1—19).

He supposes himself interrupted (v. 19) with the question ‘Have ycu no faults
of your own ⁴? '

Vv. 20—28. Ι pretend, he answers, to no infallibility. That is the vice of the
censorious in private life. They are blind to their own faults, keen of sight
to their neighbours.

29—37. Little faults of temper or manner or dress overshadow sterling merits.

38-40. Contrast the lover turning his mistress's defects into beauties.

40-54. If friendship cannot go as far as that, it can imitate a father making the
best of his boy’s deformities.

’ 5 5—66. But we even turn virtues into vices.

66-69. This censoriousness recoils on ourselves—for we have our own faults too. ἢ

69-7 5. We need (Ι) mutual forbearance.

76-79. (2) some discrimination of the relative gravity of saults.

80-95. We see this in other cases. We should think a man mad who crucified =
a slave for a peceadillo. Is it not worse to break off a friendship because of l
some trifling accident or impropriety? What are we to do when it comes to ζ
graver offences ¹? Ἰ

96-98. The Stoic will tell you that all offences are equal ; but thid doctrine
will not square with life, neither with moral feeling nor with utility, the true
basis of moral distinction.

9S-1 1 2. Historically the sense of justice is posterior to the experience of injustiee.

113—116. The Stoic is wrong in assuming a natural criterion of right and wrong,
wrong in his conclusion that one breach os law is as bad as another.

116-124. We need a just apportionment of punishment to offence. Not that 1
fear too great leniency. It is the rule of Draco that we are promised when
the Stoic is king.

124-126. ‘When he is king,' do I say? Why, he is king, so he tells us, as he
is everything else that is good.

126—1h33. A {toic is supposed to reply, ‘ You forget Chrysippus’ explanation of Ι
t e para ox.’

133—142. ‘VVelL' Horace answers, ‘it is a poor sovereignty. It does not '
save you from humiliations. No one recognizes it except Crispinus. I shall
leave you your throne, contented for myself to live on terms of mutual for-
bearance with my unphilosophical friends!

 

The connection of vv. 1-19 with the rest of the poem is not made perfectly
clear3 but the comparison in the following Satire, vv. 78—104‚ between the inno- ἵ
cent sallies of Satire, half playful and directed against types rather than per-
sons, with the lieense given to real malignity in private conversation, seems to show
that this is the link here also, and the true subject of the Satire.
