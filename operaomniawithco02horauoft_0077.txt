the public baths, apparently as a per-
quisite. The Comm. Cruq. says it was
with the view of offering incense ‘pro
felici hospitum adventu! In this ease
his offence would be officiousness as
well as sels-importance. Various other
purposes have been suggested by editors
early and late: the heating of branding
irons for criminals who came before him,
incense for the inauguration of his court ;
some have thought that ⁴ fireshovel’ is a
contemptuous name for something car-
ried before the ‘ praetor,' perhaps a
clumsy imitation of the ‘scipio eburneus’
of the consul. It was proposed early to
read ‘ bacillum.' a ‘little staff’ or ‘wands
which Cruquius supported by reference
to the passage quoted above from Cic.
de Leg. Agr. 2. 34, where there is men—
tion of the ‘baculi’ carried before the
magistrates of a country town. To suit
this ‘prunae’ has been further altered
to ‘ pruni,’ ‘a wand of plum-trec
wood.’

37. Mamurrarum urbe. A satirical
description, ‘the city of Mamurra⁷s
family,' as though it would be best
known to the world as the birth-place os

ι one whose wealth and scandals were
⁴ still in men's thoughts, the favourite of

Julius Caesar, Suet. Jul. Caes. 73,

¹ ‘decoctor Formianus' of Catull. 41.

The place is Formiae (hod. Mola di
Gaeta) on the Sinus Caietanus.

Α 3. 19. 11. They lodged in the house of

i Murena, Maecenas' brother—in-law‚ who
¹ it would seem was absent. The supper

was provided by Fonteius Capito, one
of the company, who also may have had
a villa at Formiae, or who may have
brought cook and materials for the

' ’ entertainment.

Virgil’s two literary executors, Varius

being the other. The three friends come
together. Cf. the conjunctior] in Sat. 1.
10. 81 ‘ Plotius et Varius Maecenas
Vergiliusque.’ Horace owed his own
acquaintance with Maecenas to Varius
and virgil, Sat. 1. (ι. 54.

neque quis : answering not to

‘ so long as 1 ain in my senses‚’ as in Sat.

45. Campano ponti, a bridge over
the Savo (hod. Savone), which here was
the boundary of Latium and Campania.
It was three miles beyond Sinuessa.
There is nothing to indicate whether
the ‘villula’ was a private house or
a public place of recepffion, whether an
inn or a posting-house where travelling
officials (‘qui reipublicae causa iter
faciunt’ Porph.) received such enter-
tainment as the ‘ parochi' were bound
to supply. This was limited, by a
‘lex Iulia de repetundis‚⁷ to beds, luel,
salt, and sodder sor horses; see Cic. ad
Att. 5. 16. The beginning of the prae-
tice is described in Liv. 42. Ι, and other
allusions to it are found in Cic. ad Att.
