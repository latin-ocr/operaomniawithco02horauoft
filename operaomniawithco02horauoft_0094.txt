SATIRE VII.

RUPILIUS REX.

A PERSONAL anecdote from Horace's experience in the short period that he was
attached to Brutus' fortunes. Brutus, who was ‘ Praetor urbanus ‘ in the year 44,
had been promised by Caesar the province of Macedonia, and after a struggle with
C. Antonius, who had been actually nominated to it by the Senate, took posses-

sion of it at the beginning of B.C. 43. Cassius had in a similar way taken posses- ff
sion of the province os Syria. In the course of this year C. Trebonius, another of ²

the conspirators, who, having been consul in 45, had received the proconsular pro-
vince of Asia, was treacherously murdered by Dolabella. This brought both
Brutus and Cassius into Asia. .

The scene of the story is laid at Clazomenae on the bay of Smyrna, where ³
Brutus is represented as holding a ‘ conventus' as though he were ‘ proeonsuL' ,

The story all leads up to the play on the name of ‘ Rex,' with which it concludes, ·
and which was of a kind which gave especial pleasure to Romans: but it is told
with some humour, aud the different types of the two litigants are well
marked, the half-Greek trader and money-lender, courtly, fluent, witty, and the
country-bred Roman of Praeneste, with his thick skin and heavy-handed sarcasms.

There is no certain indication of the date, but everything points to an early one.
The joke on Brutus's act (v. 34), is one most naturally made before his tragical
end, and is at any rate one which Horace would have avoided when he had 2.
come to Rome and had realized that the world was passing to ‘ Caesar's avenger.'

The Scholiasts have a story that the Satire was written by way of revenge on ’
