HORATII SATIRARUM

Non aliam ob causam nisi quod virtus in utroque

10, 11. The construction is not cer-
tain. (1) Acr. interpreted ‘iure’ by
‘exemplo, pacto, modo, potestate) If
this could be, the sentence would run
‘ for all [i. e. all combatants] are awk-
ward to deal with [ἀρ’γάλεοι, χαλεποί
εἶσι] by that right [i. e. in virtue of that
quality] by which brave men are so
who meet in single combat.' Heindorf
thought to amend this, but hardly
does so, by taking the clause ‘ quihus
adversum bellum incidit' as qualify-
ing ‘omnes.’ It seems clear that ‘bel-
lum,’ both here and in V. 16, has its
proper sense of actual combat, and is
opposed to civil quarrels. (2) The
Comm. Cruq. led the way in making
‘ molesti‘ the subject, and taking ‘hoc
iure sunt ⁷ as -—· ‘ hanc potestatem sibi vin-
dicant,⁷ ‘all quarrelsome persons have
the right which brave men have who
meet in single combat,' viz. to fight their
quarrels to the death. This has on the
whole been the usual interpretation,
being followed by Lambinus, Torren-
tius, Orelli, Ritter, Yonge, Schutz‚ and
Palmer.

Neither is quite satisfactory. The
use of ‘iure' in μ), and the constr. ‘hoc
iure sunt’ sor ‘ hoc ius habent ' in (2),
both want support. Perhaps while ac-
cepting the first interpretation generally,
we had better separate ‘hoc ’from ‘iure’
and take it as the instrum. abl. with
‘molesti,' answ-ered to by ‘quo,' ‘are
troublesome by this [quality] 'z ‘iure’
may then either be taken in its com-
mon sense, frequent in Hor., ‘rightly‚'
εἰκότως, or perhaps as opposed to ‘bel-
lum‚’ ‘in law,’ ‘ in civil suits : ² cp. its
use in ‘iure consultus,' ‘iure pe1·itus,'
and notice that when the threads are
taken up in vv. 18. 24, we have ‘ in ins
acres procurrunt! For the neuter ‘hoc

.. . quo' compare Sat. 2. 1. 50 ‘quo
quisque valet,' etc. ⁵ Hoc ’ here: ‘ vir-
tute’ (v. 15)
weapon which makes them ‘ molesti ' to
their opponents.

1 1. inter . . . inter, an illogical but a
Latin use. Epp. 1. 2. 11 ‘ Nestor com-
ponere lites Peliden festinat et inter
Atriden? Cic. de Am. 25. 95 ‘ quod in-
tersit inter popularem civem et inter con-
stantem.' He takes two instances of
single combat from the Iliad, that of
Hector and Achilles in Il. 22, which

ends in Hector's death, and that of g*

Glaucus and Diomede in Il. 6, which
ends in the exchange of armour (χρύσεα
χαλκείωνδ in which Glaucus has the
worst of it. Horace, either from his
own view (cp. Epp. Ι. ΖΝ, or following
later tradition, emphasizes the hals-
comic aspect of this exchange as
though it implied surrender on Glaucus'
side.

13. ira capitalis.

ultima, i. e.
‘ death.’

15. vexet. Two ‘ cowards' (for ⁴ in-

welcome a quarrel.

17. pigrior. Cp. ‘ impiger,’ the epi-
thet of Achilles A. P. 121.

18. missis. ‘proffered' This would ’

be inexact if it were applied directly to

Glaucus, for in Homer the proposal of

exchange came from Diomede.
