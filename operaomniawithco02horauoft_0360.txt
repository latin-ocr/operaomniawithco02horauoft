HORATII EPISTULARUM

Naevius in manibus non est et mentibus haeret

Paene recens? Adeo sanctum est vetus omne poema.
Ambigitur quotiens, uter utro sit prior, aufert 55
Pacuvius docti famam senis, Accius alti,

Dicitur Afrani toga convenisse Menandro,

Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi,

Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.

Hos ediscit et hos arto stipata theatro 60
Spectat Roma potens; habet hos numeratque poetas

53. ‘ Nay, is not Naevius, who is still
older and more crabbed, read and re—
membered by everyone as though he
wrote yesterday 3‘ Bentley has the
credit of restoring sense by putting the
question at ‘recens' Ritter alone of
modern editors retains the old reading
without it.

mentibus haeret: so Cic. Tusc. D. 3.
2. 3 ‘poetae qui audiuntur, leguntur,
ediscuntur et inhaerescunt penitus in
mentibus.’

55. In the talk of such literary circles
the merits of Pacuvius and Accius are
often discussed, but it is only to ask
which is the greater poet, and what is
the appropriate adjective to characterize
each.

56. docti, alti are the cant epithets.
Quintilian (10. 1. 97), doubtless with
these words in mind, writes ‘virium
Accio plus tribuitur; Pacuvium videri
doctiorem qui esse docti affectant volunt.’

Pacuvius: the nephew of Ennius,
lived between ΚΕ. 219 and 129.

Accius was born Rc. 170, and was
alive in B. C. 87. They were both tragic
poets. For Accius see Sat. 1. 10. 53,
A. P. 2 58.

senis, ‘ an ancient‘3
1. 34.

57. dieitur : i. e. this is the talk.

toga. The form of expression is
chosen (after the model of ‘ cothurnus'
for ‘tragedy‚' etc.) because Afranius
wrote ‘togatae ⁷ : to say that ‘ his gown
was the very fit of Menander‚' is to say
that his comedies were of the character
and value of Menander’s.

58. A line of doubtful meaning.
Horace is giving, as in the other cases,
not his own judgment, but the too
favourable criticism of admirers of
Plautus. Orelli explains properare of
Plautus' rapidity of dramatie movement

see on Sat. 2.

(cp. ‘ ad eventum festinat' A. P. 148);
Ritter, of the quick strides that he
makes towards catching up his model.
It is possible that ‘ properare ' is a word
which would be used by adverse critics,
as Horace himself (see infr. v. 174 foll„
where he charges him with too rapid
composition) and that his friends are

.represented as making the best os this

by saying that it is an imitation of
Epicharmus. Siculi is a touch of learn-
ing on the part of the critics, and implies,
by identifying him, ‘the master? ‘ Epi-
charmus‚’ the Dorian comic poet, was
born at Cos Β. C. 540, but spent his life
in Sicily.

59. vincere. The comparison is
between Caecilius and Terence, not be-
tween them and Plautus.

Caecilius. Caecilius Statius died
B.C. 168, two years before the appear-
ance of Terence’s first play. Cicero
(de Opt. Gen. Orat. 1. 2) gives him
provisionally (⁶ si cui ita videtur') the
first place as a comic W1iter.

60-62. hos . . . hos . . . hos, ‘these
and these only.' ‘These are the poets
learnt by heart in schools; these are the
dramatists that Romans will crowd into
a close theatre to see acted; this is the
complete and final list from the days of
Livius Andronicus (the father of Roman
literature, who began to exhibit trage-
dies in Rome 240 B.c.) to the present
da .'

>671. potens, ‘this mighty Rome of
ours': cp. Od. 4. 3. 13; but here, as
Schiitz points out, there is some irony in
the epithet. A contrast is suggested
between her greatness in other respects
and her humble standard in literar-y
taste. Cp. A. P. 289 f. ‘Nec vi1tute
foret clarisve potentius armis Quam
lingua Latium si non,⁵ etc.
