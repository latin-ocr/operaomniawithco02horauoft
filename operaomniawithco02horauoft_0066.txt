Quo personatus pactor pater.

HORATII SATIRARUM

His, ego quae nunc,

Olim quae scripsit Lucilius, eripias si

Tempora certa modosque, et quod prius ordine verbum est
Posterius facias, praeponens ultima primis,

Non, ut si solvas ‘Postquam Discordia tetra 60
Belli ferratos postes portasque refregit,'

Invenias etiam disiecti membra poetae.

Hactenus haec: alias iustum sit necne poema,

Nunc illud tantum quaeram, meritone tibi sit

Suspectum genus hoc scribendi.

Sulcius acer 65

Ambulat et Caprius, rauci male cumque libellis,

Magnus uterque timor latronibus, at bene si quis

Et vivat puris manibus contemnat utrumque.

Ut sis tu similis Caeli Birrique latronum,

Non ego sim Capri neque Sulci; cur metuas me? 70

56. personatus, adj. from ‘ persona‚'
wearing a mask; ‘the father on the
stane)

ξδ’. tempora certa modosque. The
adj. belongs to both subst. Cp. the
equivalent ‘ pedibus numerisque ' os v. 7,
‘ regularity in quantities and rhythn1.’

60. The Schol. here and Servius on
Virg. Aen. 7. 622 ‘Belli ferratos rupit
Saturnia postes ³ attribute these verses to
Ennius.

62. etiam with disiecti: ‘ in our case
you would not recognise, as you would
in the case of Ennius, the limbs, even
though you had dismembered him, of
a oet.’

133. iustum, ‘ proper,’ ‘legitimate.'
The subj. is ‘ genus hoc scribendi.’

65. Sulcius . . . Caprius, ‘ delatores
et causidici ’ Porph. Neither appellation
can be strictly accurate, as the use of
· delator' for an informer is post—Augus-
tan and ‘causidicus' is a term of the
civil not criminal courts. Itis usually
supposed that the persons meant are
professional accusers <such as are called
‘quadruplatores’ Cic. Div. in Caec. 7.
24 et al.) Ritter prefers to think of the
‘ apparitores ' of the aediles, i. e. police
officers. The names here may possibly
be literary. Caelius occurs in Lucil. 30.
117, and in a context (‘ut semel in
Caeli pugnas te invadere vidi ’), which
is not unsuitable to a ‘ latro.'

acer, as ‘ canis acer,' ‘of keen scent.'
Perhaps Horace has actually in mind

the comparison of accusers to watch—
dogs, which is in view in Epod. 6, and
which forms the subject of an elaborate
paragraph in Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 20.
55-57, a passage which well illustrates
the view that the class here spoken of
are men who made a trade of accusation.

66. rauci male, 4 valde? Schol.‚ the
adverb intensifying the unpleasant signi—
fication of the adj. See on Od. 1. 17.
25. Perhaps ‘ with ill omened croak.'
They are hoarse with bawling in court.

libellis, notes of the case, deposi-
tions, or other documents which the
accusers would carry into court, as Juv.
of the ‘ causidicus: Sat. 7. 107 ‘ comites
in fasce libelli?

69. ut, concessive, ‘even suppose
that ;' Madv. ἕ 440 a, obs. 4.

70-73. The moods in this passage
have caused considerable discussion.
‘Sim ' has been altered (35 by Heind.
and Orelli) to 4 sum.’ On the other hand
Bentley, following some inferior MSS. of
Lambinus, would read ‘ recitem.’ Orelli
is unwilling to allow the general
potential use ‘modeste affirmantis’ of
the present subjunctive. He therefore
alters ‘sim,’ and makes ‘habeat ’ opta-
tive. If we keep ‘sim' it is possible
either to make it the apodosis to ‘ut
sis,' ‘even though you be like Caelius
Ι need not be like Caprius,' οι· perhaps
better (with Lambinus> to make it a
further supposition in the concessive
clause, the apodosis being ‘cur metuas
