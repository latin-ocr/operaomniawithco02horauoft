HORATII SATIRARUM

Iratus buccas inflet, neque se fore posthac

Tam facilem dicat, votis ut praebeat aurem?

Praeterea ne sic, ut qui iocularia, ridens

Percurram: quamquam ridentem dicere verum

Quid vetat? ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi 25
Doctores, elementa velint ut discere prima:

Sed tamen amoto quaeramus seria ludo:

Ille gravem duro terram qui vertit aratro,

Perfidus hic caupo, miles nautaeque per omne

de F als. Leg. 4425, is used rather of
the grimaces of sels-importance; but
φυσᾶν is used in both senses. Plautus
(Bacch. 4. 2. 21) has ‘sufflari' of an
angry soldier. Cp. perhaps Horace’s
own expression A. P. 94 ‘iratus . ..
tumido delitigat ore.’

illis: it is indifferent whether we con-
sider it as a dat. after the anger of
‘iratus' or the expression of anger in
‘ buccas inflet.'

ambas, like the Greek emphatic dual
(as χεῖρε, ὄσσε), giving a rhetorical force,
although it is one which will not bear
pressing logically‚ as though he could
actually puff one cheek without the
other.

23. praeterea: another Lucretian
formula of transition. He passes, with
an apology for his satirical tone, to
the second proof of the unreality of the
wish for change, namely, that though
men of all trades profess to toil for
the sake of attaining the power to
rest, they are never satisfied to take
the rest.

ut qui iocularia, sc. ‘percurrit,‘ or
perhaps some more colourless verb, as
'narrat’ or ‘tractat‚’ to be supplied
from ‘percurram.'
Sat. 1. 3.9, 1. 8. 32.

iocularia. Cic. de Leg. 1. 20. 53

For the ellipse cp.

·’ ioculare istuc quidem et a multis saepe
derisum‚' sc. a saying ofjest, a drollery.
Heindorf thinks the word had a definite
reference to the badinage of the Atel-
lanae, quoting Livy's account os the
beginning of stage-plays at Rome (7. 2)
‘iuventus . . . inconditis inter se iocularia
fundentes versibus? The quotation
however does not establish any technical
sense in the word itself. It is not clear
what the special lightness of treatment is
sor which Horace apologizes. Can the
dramatic picture, the apparition and

offer of the deity, the tragi-comic anger
of Jupiter, be a parody3

24· percurram can hardly be intrans.
‘run on to the end‚’ as Dillr. and
others, for as we saw we have to elicit
from it a transitive verb in order to
govern ‘iocularia' It seems to mean
‘ pass lighssy, rapidly‚ by.'

25. olim, the indefinite time of similes
or fables: Epp. 1. 10. 42, 2. 2. 197, and
see on Epod. 3. 1.

crustula. Sat. 2. 4. 47, dim. of
‘ crustum‚' small pastry.

blandi, ‘ coaxing.' Horace is no
doubt thinking of Lucretius’ simile 1.
936 foll.

26. elementa, their ‘ alphabet.' Epp.
1. 1. 27.

27. sed tamen: not introducing the
apodosis or leading clause to ‘ne sic
. . ,percurram’ (that is to be looked
for in the contffiuance, in an altered key,
of the direct statement, ‘Ille gravem,‘
etc.. sce on Od. 1. 33. 1), but a con-
clusion of the parenthesis; ‘but yet,
though satirical humour has its place
and use, let us sor the moment be
grnge'. 29. ille . . . hic, δεικτικῶς. Cp.
v. 11.

gravem dum, for the relation of the
epithet, see on Od. 1. 3. 10: the plough
had need to be tough if the ground is
heavy: cp. also Epod. 5. 30. It is the
hard toil of the ploughman which is in
point.

perfidus caupo. Cp. Sat. 1. 5. 4
‘ cauponibus malignis.' The purpose of
the epithet adds to its sting. He is
naming in the ease of each profession
what costs the most toil. The tavern-
keeper's hard cheating is set off against
the countryman's ploughing, the sol-
dier's campaigning‚ the trader's danger-
ous voyages.
