HORATII EPISTULARUM

‘Forum putealque Libonis

Mandabo siccis, adimam cantare severis:'

Hoc simul edixi, non cessavere poetae 10
Nocturno certare mero, putere diurno.

Quid, si quis vultu torvo ferus et pede nudo

Exiguaeque togae simulet textore Catonem,

Virtutemne repraesentet moresque Catonis?

Rupit Iarbitam Timagenis aemula lingua, 15

master Epicurus, 3. 9. Cp. ‘ pater
Aeneas' Od. 4. 7. 15, ‘pater Chry-
sippus' Sat. 1. 3. 126.

arma: with reference to his patriotic
poem the Annales.

8. puteal Libonis. Burn (Rome
and Campagna, p. 86) recognizes two
‘ putealia' in the Forum Romanum; one
in the ‘comitium,' which is described by
Cicero (de Div. 1. 7. 33) as the place
where the razor of Attius Navius was
buried, and which was close to the
original tribunal ofthe Praetor Urbanus;
the other ‘puteal Libonis' or ‘Scri-
bonianum‚' which is placed by the
Scholiast on this passage, and on Pers.
Sat. 4. 4«) ‘ prope arcum Fabianum,⁷ i. e.
at the eastern end of the Forum. They
say that this also was by the praetor⁷s
tribunal, possibly after its removal by
Julius Caesar described by Dion Cass.
43. 49. See however the note on Sat. 1.
6. 35. The passages in which the
‘ puteal ' is alluded to (Pers. Sat. 4. 49,
Ov. R. A. 561 ‘ Qui puteal Ianumque
timet celeresque Kalendas,' Cic. Sest.
8. 18 ‘ puteali et feneratorum gregibus
inflatus‘) point rather to a place of
money transactions than to a legal tri-
bun-al.

9. mandabo. Orelli points out that
the future is probably an imitation of
the usual form of a praetor's edict,
quoting the instances given in Cic. Verr.
Aet 2. 1. 44 and 45 ‘ possessionem dab0,’
‘ hereditatem dabo.'

siccis: Od. ι. 18. 3.

severis: Catull. 27. 5 ‘At vos quo
libet hinc abite, lymphae, Vini pernicies
et ad severos Migrate.' For the infin.
aster adimam see vol. 1. App. 2. ξ 1.

10. edixi, as a praetor: see the
last note, and cp. Sat. 2. 2. 51.

11. certare mero: Od. 4. 1. 31
The rhythm of this line is like that of
A. P. 269.

13. exiguae: ep. ‘arta' Epp. 1. 18.
30.
textore, the ‘tailor'=the ‘cut’ of
the gown.

Catonem. Cato of Utica, as in Od.
2. 1. 24 : ep. Plutarch's life of him, c. 6
πολλάκις δ’ ἀνυπόδητος καῖ ἀχίτων εἷς τὸ
δημόσιον προσῄει, and the full description
in Lucan 2. 372.

15. An allusion to some story which
cannot now be recovered. Timagenes
we learn from other sources (Suidas
s. v.), to have been a rhetorician of the
time at Rome, who was famous for
a witty tongue, which gained him, and
again in the end lost him, the favour of
Augustus. For ‘Iarbita' we have
nothing but discordant scholia. The
name is apparently coined from Iarbas
(the name os a king of Numidia men-
tioned in Liv. Epit. 89, used by virgil
for the Numidiam suitor of Dido in Aen.
4) with the Greek gentile termination
-ιτης, They agree in calling him
‘Maurus geuere.⁷ One adds that his
name was Cordus, possibly to be written
Codrus. This has suggested the Codrus
of Virg. Eel. 5. 10, 7. 26, assumed,
rightly or wrongly, to have been the
real name osa poet os the time. The
expression in the latter of the two pas—
sages ‘invidia rumpantur ut ilia
Codro' has been taken as an illustration
os ‘ rupit Iarbitam . . . aemula lingua,'
aud may possibly have been present to
the mind of the Scholiasts when they
explain ‘ rupit ' by ‘ invidia.' This how-
ever will not bear examination. Con-
ington pointed out that the words in
Virgil are put into the mouth of a
spiteful rival, not meant to give a true
trait of Codrus. And Horace is here
talking not of envy but of imitation,
sincere but misdirected. The Scholiasts
offer an alternative explanation of
rupit as used literally of some internal
