300 HORATII EPISTULARUM

of an Epistle? In any case the literary effect is dramatically to represent a class
of aspirants, irresolute at first and half ashamed of being patronized‚ yet driven to
it by greediness and the importunity of relatives, and in danger when they enter

on it of turning out beggars and grumblers?

QUAMVIS, Scaeva, satis per te tibi consulis, et scis

Quo tandem pacto deceat maioribus uti,

Disce, docendus adhuc, quae censet amiculus, ut si

Caecus iter monstrare velit3 tamen aspice si quid

Et 1105, quod cures proprium fecisse, loquamur. 5
Si te grata quies et primam somnus in horam

Delectat, si te pulvis strepitusque rotarum,

Si laedit caupona, Ferentinum ire iubebo.

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia solis,

Nec vixit male, qui natus moriensque fefellit. 10
Si prodesse tuis pauloque benignius ipsum

Te tractare voles, accedes siccus ad unctum.

2. tandem. The particle osten used
in direct questions to give emphasis is
here kept in the indireet question. With
Orelli and Diintzer we may take it to
imply that the question is a diffieult
one.

111310110115-ζ 1110 great ‘—th0se greater
than yourself, as in Sat. 2. 1. 61. They
are called ‘potentes amici' in Epp. Ι.
IS. 44, ‘ potentiores’ in Epod. 2. 8.

uti, sc. ‘familiariter,' as in vv. 13,14;
see on Epp. 1.12. 22.

3. doeendus adhue. ‘ who still
needs plenty ofschooling himself.’

amiculus: the diminutive os depre-
ciation‚ ‘ a humble friend) Possibly
there is reference to ‘ maioribus‚’ a friend
who is not one of the great, but as small
35 yourself. But it is all ironical ; see
introd.

4. tamen: in spite of these draw-
backs to the value of his advice.

5. et nos, ‘ even such 35 1.⁷

eureS, ‘ you may take the trouble.‘

fecisse: for the perf. inf. see on Od.
3. 4. 51, and ep. Epp. 1. 18. 59.

6. primam in horam. For one who
has a patron to please must be up before
daybreak to call at his house: ‘ sollicitus
ne Tota salutatrix iam turba peregerit
orbem Sideribus dubiis ' Juv. S. 5. 20, ‘ si
curet nocte togatus Currere ' ib. 3. 127.
Cp. Epp.1. 7. 68 and 75, 2. 1.104‚ and
Martial 4. 8. 1 ‘ Prima salutantes atque
altera continet horas For the meaning
of ‘prima hora' see on Sat. 1. 5. 23.

7. pulvis strepitusque rotarum.
Obbar well compares the Nux Elegia
89 (of the walnut planted in the coun-
try) ‘ Non hominum strepitus audit, non
illa rotarum : N on a vicina pulverulenta
via est.'

8. caupona: i.e. the noise of taverns
in the streets of Rome.

Ferentinum: i. e. a quiet country
town. Two places of the name are
known, one on the Via Latina, sorty-
eight miles from Rome, in the country
of the Hernici, which the Comm. Cruq.
understands to be meant, the other in
Etruria.

The gist of the line is ‘If you are
sineere in saying that the claims of
society bore you, shake them off, but
do it ffloroughly, go quite into the
country.’

10. vixit male: the opp. of ‘bene
vivere’ Epp. 1. 6. 56.

natus moriensque fefellit, ‘has been
born and died unknown ²: an imitation
of the use of λανθάνειν with the part.
Cp. Od. 3. 16. 20. Plutarch quotes as
an Epicurean precept λάθε βιώσας. Cp.
Ov. Trist. 3. 4. 25 ‘bene qui latuit,
bene vixit,’ and the ‘fallentis semita
vitae ’ os the next Epistle, v. 103.

11. benignius ipsum tractare: cp.
‘tractari mollius ⁷ Sat. 2. 2. 85.

12. siccus ad unctum. The Scho-
11351 gives, no doubt, the sense, ‘ sc. pauper
ad opulentum,’ and generally the figure
employed is elear3 but it is doubtful
