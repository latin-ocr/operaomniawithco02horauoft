HORATII SATIRARUM

Flebit et insignis tota cantabitur urbe.

Cervius iratus leges minitatur et urnam,

Canidia Albuci quibus est inimica venenum,

Grande malum Turius, si quid se iudice certes.

Ut quo quisque valet suspectos terreat, utque 5³
Imperet hoc natura potens, sic collige mecum:

Dente lupus, cornu taurus petit: unde nisi intus
Monstratum? Scaevae vivacem crede nepoti

Matrem3 nil faciet sceleris pia dextera: mirum,

Ut neque calce lupus quemquam neque dente petit bos: 55
Sed mala tollet anum vitiato melle cicuta.

Ne longum faciam: seu me tranquilla senectus

Exspectat seu Mors atris circumvolat alis,

Dives, inops, Romae, seu fors ita iusserit, exul,

Quisquis erit vitae scribam color.

46. flebit, κλαύσεται, as ‘ cantabi-
tur’ recalls the use of ὑμνεῖσθαι, in the
sense of ‘to be the subject of talk)

47. Cervius,aninformer. The Comm.
Cruq. has ‘ Cervius Ascanii libertus ca-
lumniator accusavit Cn. Calvinum lege
de sicariis? Lambinus read ⁶ Servius‚' in
which case Horace would take the name
from Cicero, ad Q. Fr. 2. 13 ⁴ vereor ne
hoino teter ac ferus Pola Servius ad
accusationem veniat.'

48. Canidia Albuci venenum. The
Scholiasts‚ by the diversity of their
explanations‚ show us that they had no
real source of information. They offer
us ‘Canidia Albuci' ζ( sub. filia ut, Verg.
·” Deiphobe Glauci'' (Aen. 6. 36) vel
uxor, ut Hectoris Andromache' (Aen.
3. 319) ), or ‘ Albuci venenu1n,’ which
may mean either ⁶ such as Albucius ad-
ministered,’ or ‘ such as she administered
to Albucius! Of these the last is the
most probable. The identification of
Canidia is not needed to readers of Sat.
I and the Epodes. The introduction of
a second employer of poison overloads
the line, and weakens the attack on
Horace‘s great enemy. On the other
hand the hint of a special crime and of
a companion to the ⁴ Varus’ of Epod. 5
is quite in keeping with his treatment of
her. ‘ Albucius’ is a name from Lucilius,
inc. 9. Horace uses it again of an old
man who is a tyrant to his slaves, Sat.
2. 2. 67.

49. Turius, ‘iudex corruptissimus'

‘O puer, ut sis 60

Schol. Their attempts at identification
are various and not of value.

50. ‘ That every one uses the weapon
with which he is strong to frighten
those whom he suspects, and that this
is the bidding of nature, whose will is
law, join with me in thus inferring.’

51. sic collige. Epp. 2. 1. 129.

52. unde, with monstratum, ‘a
lesson learnt from whence, if not from
within '? i. e. from instinct. It has been
also taken as = ‘ quare,' ‘ wherefore.
unless as a lesson learnt from within'?
but cp. ‘unde datum sentis’ Sat. 2. 2.
31. With intus cp. A. P. 108.

54. mirum, a parenthetical holding
up the hands, ‘ marvellous.’ The next
line rebukes the wonder by giving the
explanation, ‘ Yes, on the same ground
that the wolf does not use his heels nor
the bull his teeth.’ Schutz compares
the place of ‘ mirum' to that of ‘ durum '
in Od. 1. 24. 19.

56. vitiato, ‘ poisoned.⁷

melle, i.e. the drink of honey and
wine; see Sat. 2. 2. 15, 2. 4. 24.

57. ne longum faciam, Sat. Ι. 3.
137 ; so ‘ ne te morer' Sat. 1. 1. 14.

58. circumvolat, as a dread bird of
prey,—a touch of poetry.

60. scribam. For the order of the
words see on Sat. 1. 5. 72. The unusual
collocation seems to give emphasis to
the misplaced word, as in the similar
instance Sat. 2. 3. 211 ‘Aiax eum im-
meritos occidit, desipit, agnos?
