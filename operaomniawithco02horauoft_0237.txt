these is Ritter. The latter by those who think it to be addressed to a boy. (3) As,
a cognomen. This is no new theory, having been held by Scaliger, but it has
gained general belief since Meineke’s advocacy of it. There is no trustworthy
evidence of the cognomen borne by M. Lollius, the consul of B. C. 21. Under the
Republic the only cognomen found in the gens Lollia is Palicanus. A grand-
daughter of his is called ‘ Lollia Paullina‚' and this has been supposed to indicate
that the cognomen was Paullinus. But the whole question of cognomina at this
period is very obscure. A ‘Lollius Maximus’ is found in an inscription, but of
a much later date. Keller compares Ovid's address (ex Pont. 2. 8. 2 and 3. 5. 6)
‘ Maxime Cotta’ to the son of Messalla, the orator, who had been adopted into the
Aurelia gens, and bore apparently both the cognomen which belonged to it, and
that of Maximus, an old cognomen in the Valeria gens, to which by birth he be-
longed.

Ι. Maxime Lolli. Taking‘Maxime'
as a cognomen (see introd.), notice the
inversion of the two names, as in Od.

2. declamas, osa young man practis-
ing the art of speaking under the guid-
ance of a ‘ rhetor.’ Cicero describes
himself as doing so Brut. 90. 310

see Mayor on Juv. S. 7. 150.

Praeneste, a haunt of Horace; see
Od. 3. 4. 23 n. It does not follow that
he possessed a house there.

3. pulchrum . . . utile ε καλόν,
χρήσιμον. The two tests of action
according to Cic. de Off. 1. 3. 10.

4. planius. The Bland. MSS. seem
here to have had the worse reading
‘plenius’ The Pseudo-Acron had
‘ planius,' which he interprets by ‘ aper-
tius‚' the Comm. Cruq. by ‘ manifestius)
‘ Plenius ' would involve an unnecessary
paradox. as Chrysippus and Crantor are
both spoken of as most voluminous
writers. For Chrysippus-the Stoic see
on Sat. 1. 5. 126. Crantor was an Aca-
demic, ‘ Legimus omnes Crantoris veteris
Academici de luctu ' Cic. Academ.

form Od. 3. 5. 38, 3.14.18‚ 4. 15. 8;
Epp. 2. 1. 254, 2. 2. 98. Notice, with
Orelli, the effect of the sonorous verse
with its heroic tone, in contrast with
the preceding line, in emphasizing the
inadequacy of the cause and the serious-
ness of the result.

8. stultorum. In the philosophieal
sense, as opposed to the ‘sapiens’
Antenor and Nestor are the philoso-
phers.
