to the λεοντοβάμων σκάφη χαλκήλατος,
mentioned in a fragment os the Sisyphus
of Aeschylus. We notice also that
Sisyphus was the mythical founder of
Corinth, the home of brass work3 cp.

2 5. Mercuriale cognomen. Cru-
quius speaks of one MS. as reading
‘ Mercurialem,' Torrentius of one or
two as reading ‘ Mercurialisss Lambinus
of several as reading ‘Mercuriali,' which
latter reading has been adopted by many
editors, including Prof. Palmer. They
seem however to be all interpretative
emendations. ‘ Mercuriale cognomen ³
has been variously understood. The
Comm. Cruq. <followed by Lambinus
and of recent editors, Heindorf, Orelli,
Ritter, Schutz) took it as meaning ‘ the
nick—name of “Mercurius.''' Acr.‚ in-
terpreting it more generally, by ‘ a nick-
name related to Mercurius' (the god of
gain), understood some name such as
‘ cerdo ² (κέρδος). Porph. seems to take
it as practically identical in sense with
the other readings, ‘ a nick-name from
Mercurius 3 ' meaning the ‘ nick-name
Mercurialis :’ ‘ Mercurialis ⁷ would not
be immediately connected with the ‘ col-
legium’ called ‘ Mercuriales’ at Rome,
but would mean ‘a favourite of Mer-
cury,’ just as Horace calls poets from
another function of Mercury’s ‘ viri Mer—

curiales ' Od. 2. 17. 29· This is followed
by Ascensius among older editors, by
Dillr. and Macleane among recent ones.

26. compita g‘peto’), broad spaces
where several streets met. They are
possibly named only as places where
men meet and talk, as in Sat. 2. 6. 50
‘ a Rostris manat per compita rumor‚'-—-
but the Scholiast explains it probably
of the auctions which took place com-
monly in such places. Cicero (nde Leg.
Agr. 1. 3. 7) speaks of an auction held
‘in atriis auctionariis' instead of ‘in
triviis aut compitis ' as a hole-and-corner
proceeding. Damasippus was known
to the frequenters of auctions as the
most skilful of purchasers.

28. mire answers ‘miror'; ‘it is a
marvel—but it is as happens in physical
maladies also.⁷ Doubts have been en-
tertained what the new malady is, but
the differences are not as deep as some
editors represent. The Scholiasts ex-
plain it of the Stoic philosophy, and so
Ritter‚ saying that Damasippus would
accommodate his language to Horace,
‘what you would eall a new malady.⁷
It is pointed out as against this that
Stoicism has not yet been named. But,
though not his philosophy, it is his philo-
sophising, his readiness to lecture others,
to meddle in other people’s business (v.
19). Damasippus will not allow even of
himself the uncorrected phrase ‘ morbi
purgatum.’ For him, as for all but the
true philosopher, it was only a question
of one mental malady or another. When
Horace (v. 31) by his light answer seems
to be missing his drift he presses the
lesson home, ‘I sear you mistake me’
(ὅ de te fabula narratur ²)—‘y0u are mad
also—and well nigh all the world.'
