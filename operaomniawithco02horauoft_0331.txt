EPIST. 18.

315

Qua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum3
Num te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,
Num pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes;

Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane donet3

100

Quid minuat curaS, quid te tibi reddat amicum3
Quid pure tranquillet, honos an dulce lucellum,
An secretum iter et fallentis semita vitae.
Me quotiens reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,

Quem Mandela bibit, rugosus frigore pagus,

105

Quid sentire putas? quid credis, amice, precari?
Sit mihi quod nunc est, etiam minus, et mihi vivam

97. The general question of which
the suceeeding questions are the ex-
pansion.

traducere: a usual word in Cicero,
as Tusc. D. 3. 1 1. 25 ‘hoc quod datum est
vitae tranquille placideque traducere)

98. semper may be taken either
with ‘inops,' ‘desire always a beggar'
(cp. ‘semper avarus eget' Epp. 1. 2. 52
and ‘magnas inter opes inops‚’ of the
man who desires instead of enjoying,
Od. 3. 16. 28), or with the verbs. In
either case ‘agitet' is probably (as
Oreus» deliberative subj., although form-
ing also the matter of an indirect ques-
tion, ‘whether desire must stir and
harass,' etc. Lollius is sent to the
philosopher, not to ask what he is, but
what he ought to be.

99. pavor. It may be doubted
whether this is ‘ sear? the usual correla-
tive in Horace of desire or hope (Epp.
1. 2. 51, 1.6.12,1.16.65, etc), or as
in Epp. 1. 6. 10 ‘the flutter' of excite-
ment, common to either passion.

mediocriter utilium: ‘things far
short of the “summum bonum.'’⁷ The
phrase describes external goods, which
the Stoics classed among ἀδιάφορα, ⁴ in-
differentia ’ Cic. de Fin. 3. 15. 53.

100. ‘If the philosophers answer
“no'’ to the first question, then where
is virtue, the alternative ideal, to be
looked for?’ The question is the one
so often raised in Plato ἆρα δίδακτον
ἡ ἀρετή.

101. ‘And in any case what kind of
external life is most conducive to in—
teinal peace, the philosopheis' calm?’

te tibi reddat amioum:}3pp.1.
3. 29, ἵνα και ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς φίλοι ὠμεν και

τοῖς θεοις Plat. Rep. p. 621.

102. honos, ‘ office '; ‘the lise of
ambition.’

103. Notice the fuller description and
the sympathetic touch of poetry in this
line, indicating the poet‘s preference be-
tween the three lives. ‘ Dulce lucellum '
is a satirical designation, the epithet and
the affectionate diminutive describing the
attitude of the lover of gain, not of the
writer. For fallentis see on Epp. 1.
1 . 10.

7104. me. The reference to his own
taste suggested in v. 103, is now ern-
phasized and forms the conclusion of the
Epistle.

quotiens reficit. There is a contrast
between ⁴ reficit ⁷ and the description of
Mandela in the next line. ‘ Every time
Ι visit my Sabine home which is to me
new life (cp. ·‘ mihi me reddentis agelli '³
Epp. Ι. 14. 1, and for Horace's use of
the cold water, Epp. 1. 15. 4, 1. 16. 14),
though some people might think it
merely a bleak spot.'

The names Digentia and Mandela sur-
vive in the forms of Licenza and Bardessa,
the latter a village over-looking the
Licenza valley. See additional note to
Epp. Ι. 16.

107. etiam minus: cp. Sat 2. 6. 3

‘auctius atque Di melius fecere. Heaven
has blest him beyond his pray ers.

et, mihi vivam, i e. as my own
master. Cp the picture of the indepen-
dence which he claims m Epp. 1. 7. 1-36.
Many good MSS. have ‘ ut‚⁷ which Kel-
ler gives, as the reading of his class Ι
and ΙΙ, and as thinking that the words
in Porp h. ‘dummodo vivam quemad—
modump volo‚' imply that he found ut.'
It is possible, hovi ever that they are

only meant to give the sense, as in any
