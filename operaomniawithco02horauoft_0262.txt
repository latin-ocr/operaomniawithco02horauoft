HORATII EPISTULARUM

Quodsi me noles usquam discedere, reddes 25
Forte latus, nigros angusta fronte capillos,

Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere decorum, et

Inter vina fugam Cinarae maerere protervae.

Forte per angustam tenuis volpecula rimam

Repserat in cumeram frumenti, pastaque rursus

30

Ire foras pleno tendebat corpore frustra3

Cui mustela procul, ‘Si vis,' ait, ‘effugere istinc,
Macra cavum repetes artum, quem macra subisti.’
Hac ego si compellor imagine, cuncta resigno3

thought, though not the exact expression,
is parallel to Epp. 2. Ι. 245 ‘ At neque
dedecorant tua de se iudicia atque
Munera, quae multa dantis cum laude
tulerunt Dilecti tibi Vergilius Variusque
poetae.'

2 5. usquam discedere : see on Sat.
1. 1. 37, 2. 7. 30.

26. latus: chest, lungs: ‘ Si ventri
bene, si lateri, pedibusque tuis est ’ Epp.
1. 12. 5.

nigros angusta fronte capillos:
see on Od. 1. 33. 5 ‘tenui fronte‚’ and
cp. Plin. Epp. 3. 6. 2 ‘rari et cedentes
capilli, lata srons.’ Horace was now
‘praecanus’ Epp, 1. 20. 24, and, it is
here implied, becoming bald.

27. dulce loqui, ridere: cp. ‘ dulce
ridentem, dulce loquentem' Od. 1. 22.
23, ‘canet indoctum sed dulce’ Epp.
2. 2. 9 ; ‘ dulce ' means, so as to charm
others.

28. Some lover’s play is described.
Orelli takes inter vina as qualifying
both fugam and maerere. In any
case ‘ protervae ’ implies that the flight
is playful, and the position of ‘maerere'
implies that the mourning is not serious.
For ‘Cinara ' ep. Od. 4. Ι. 4, 4. 13. 21 ;
Epp. 1. 14. 333 and see in App. I. of
vol. 1. ‘on the unknown names in the
Odes.' Here, as in all the other places
where the name occurs, it is to recall an
epoch in the poet's life.

29. forte, like ‘olim,' a wonted par—
ticle in beginning a fable.

volpecula. This is the reading of
all MSS. and Schol. Bentley would
read ‘nitedula,' ‘a shrew-mouse,’ ex
conj.‚ arguing that a fox does not and
cannot eat corn, and that all the cir-
cumstances suit an animal much smaller
and more accustomed to human dwell-

ing-places. He shows from St. Jerome
(ad Salvinum} that a similar fable ex-
isted in which a mouse plays the part :
‘docet et Aesopi fabula plenum muris
ventrem per angustum foramen egredi
non valere.’ On the other hand the
sable‚ both in Babrius (Fab. 86) and in
the later Aesopean collections, makes
it a fox, but changes the bin of corn to
a hole or a larder with meat and bread,
and the weasel to a second fox. At-
tempts have been made to save Horace’s
credit in the second way by accepting
the reading of some inferior MSS. ‘ca-
1ne1·am,⁷ and interpreting (Dacier) ‘ ca-
meram frumenti ’ as ‘ a granary,' where
the attraction might be not the grain
but pullets and pigeons who frequented it.
Bentley shows that though Columella
says ‘ sedem frumentis optimam quibus-
dam videri horreum camera contentum,'
‘camera frumenti' could not have the
meaning necessary for this purpose.
Lachmann (on Lucr. 3. 10. 14) strongly
supports Bentley’s conjecturey and it
is received into the text by Haupt and
translated by such a conservative scholar
as Conington. Keller and Munro both
condemn it. The latter says ‘ Bentley's
famous “nitedula '' sor “volpecula ’' de-
serves all praise—it is brilliant ; is what
Horace ought to have written, but I
sadly sear did not write3 not from
ignorance probably, but because he had
in his thoughts some old-world soxes,
whose foxes were not as our foxes.’
