EPISTLE II.

TO FLORUS.

Horace's reasons for refusing to write more lyrz'cs.

Verses 1—24. YOU complain of my not writing to you ; but you are out of court.
Ι told you before you started that you must not expect it.

24, 25· You complain again that I do not send you any lyric poems as you think
I promised.

26—54. (Ι) You forget the history of my writing poetry.
I am like Lucullus' soldier—when his pocket was empty he would volunteer
for forlorn hopes; when it was full again he would do so no more. Ι had
a good education at Rome and Athens, and was started on the studies of
philosophy. The civil war carried me off in its current, and eventually sent
me home a beggar. It was then Ι began to write poetry: but I am not mad
enough to do it now I have a competence.

55—57. (2) Whatever power I had is leaving me.

58⁴64. (3) You ask for lyric poetry, but others admire Epodes, others Satires.
Which is it to be?

65—70. (4) Above all other reasons, how do you think Ι can possibly write poems
at Rome, in the press of duties?

70, 71. You say, ‘ oh! you can write in the streets.‘

72-80. Can you? No ; poetry requires quiet, woodland scenes. ·

81-86. Think of the difference between me and the real student—pedam, perhaps
you would say.

In this noisy world 1 cannot stoop to write poetry.

87-105· ‘Stoop'?' Yes; because the only way to get such poetry as Ι could
write accepted is to join a clique of mutual admiration. Ι was obliged to do
something in this way when Ι did write ς but do not ask me to go back to it.
