214 HORATII EPISTULARUM

70-75. If the world were to ask me why I do not acquiesce in its judgments, Ι
should answer, first, in the words of the old sable, that I will not enter its
den because 1 never see that any who do so come out again.

76-80. Secondly‚ that it is difficult to imitate when even where men are agreed on
the end they differ greatly as to the means z—where in the scale of disgrace

am Ι to stop ¹?—

81-90. nay, when no one man has the same taste for an hour together.
91-93. In this matter of capriciousness there is no difference os rank. The poor

follow the rich :

94—105. 1 am as bad as others ; but though you are ready to laugh at incongruities
of dress and habit, you do not notice incongruities of mind and life: or if you
do, you think them such common forms of madness as not to call either sor

cure or for restraint.

106-108. What is the conclusion? what but the sum of all the Stoic paradoxes‘?
All the world is sick, except the philosopher—he never, except when he has

a cold.

Note the accumulated irony of the ending.

(Ι) Who am Ι, to preach? 1 am

hitting myself as hard as any one. (2) What does my preaching come to? Am
I not assuming the very Stoie tone at which 1 am always laughing?

PRIMA dicte mihi, summa dicende Camena, - «ΙωΙη
Spectatum satis et donatum iarn rude quaeris,
Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo.

Non eadem est aetas, non mens.

1. Prima dicte, after Homer's ἐν σοὶ
μὲν λήξω, σέο δ’ ἄρξομαι Il. 9.97‚ Virg.
Ecl. 8. 11 (to Pollio) ‘a te principium,
tibi desinet.’ There is reference of
course to the place which Maecenas oc-
cupies in Horace's previously published
collections of poems, Epod. 1, Od. 1. 1,
Sat. 1. 1. For ‘dicere' in the sense of
‘ cantu praedicare ’ see on Od. 1. 12. 13.
Note the careful order. First the ad-
dress, which means, ‘ you have infinite
claims on me, and you know that I have
never failed to acknowledge them ’ ; then
the circumstance which should exempt
Horace srom the present request, ‘ I
have already earned and received my
discharge ‘ ; then the fact that Maecenas
is actually making the request, and the
true nature of the request—the vocative,
which gives the tone of lernonstrance,
being put between these. Then follows
in language free from metaphor, but
directly answering the ‘ iterum antiquo,'
the reason why what was possible before
is not possible now.

2. spectatum, ‘approved,'like ‘rude'
and ‘ lud0,' a technical term of the
gladiator's life. ‘Tesserae ⁷ have been
found with the inscription ‘SR ' which

Veianius armis Γᾶ

are supposed to have been presented
to gladiators as marks of popular ap·
roval.

p rude, the gladiator's wooden sword
used for practice and given to the retir-
ing gladiator as a symbol of his dis-
charge. Cic. Phil. 2. 29· 74 ‘tam bonus
gladiator rudem tam cito?' Ovid, per—
haps remembering that Horace has the
metaph. of literary effort, Ov. Trist. 4.
8. 34 ‘ Me quoque donari iam rude tem-
pus erat.⁷ Cp. Juv. S. 7. 171 ‘Ergo sibi
dabit ipse rudem.’

3. ludo, ‘the gladiator's training
school.’

4. mens, ‘inclination.’ The words
imply that the one has changed with
the other.

Veianius: evidently a retired gladiator
of note. The Scholiasts say that his
arms were dedicated at a temple of Her—
cules at Fundi (in Latium). For the
practice of dedicating to some deity the
implements of a discarded craft see on
Od. 3. 26. 3. Hercules is a natural god
for a gladiator to honour in this way3
and the Scholiasts’ note may point to
some special connection of Veianius with
Fundi and so with a temple there. No
