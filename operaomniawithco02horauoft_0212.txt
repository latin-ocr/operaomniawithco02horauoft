HORATII SATIRARUM

Captus, ut aiebat cenae pater3 acria circum

Rapula‚ lactucae, radices, qualia lassum

Pervellunt stomachum, siser, allec, faecula Coa.

His ubi sublatis puer alte cinctus acernam 10
Gausape purpureo inensam pertersit, et alter

Sublegit quodcunque iaceret inutile quodque

Posset cenantes offendere; ut Attica virgo

Cum sacris Cereris procedit fuscus Hydaspes

Caecuba vina ferens, Alcon Chium maris expers.

Hic herus: Albanum, Maecenas, sive Falernum
Te magis appositis delectat, habemus utrumque.9
Divitias miseras! Sed quis cenantibus una,
Fundani, pulchre fuerit tibi, nosse laboro.
‘ Summus ego et prope me Viscus Thurinus et infra 20

the forests of Lucania, not from the
lowlands (see on Sat. 2. 4. 40—43). It
had been killed when there was a south
wind, but not a strong scirocco. We
are probably going wrong in thinking
(with Gesner) of irony, as though the
boar was really tainted, and Nasidienus
was making the best of it.

7. cenae pater: cp. ‘ pater domus'
Sat. 2. 6. SS.

circum, garnishing the table. A
comparison with Sat. 2. 4. 73 n. makes
it appear that putting these stimulants
and condiments on the table through the
meal was a recent affectation.

8. rapula: Sat. 2. 2. 43.

9. siser, ‘ skirwort,' a plant of which
the root was pickled and eaten.

allec: Sat. 2. 4. 73.

faecula, the dim. of ‘faex.⁷
used by Luer. 2. 430.

10. alte cinctus, as was the fashion ;
‘ ex alticinctis unus atriensibus ' Phaedr.
2. 5. 11; so below v. 70 ‘praecincti.'
It gives the idea of ‘ active,’ *bustling’ :
cp. ‘altius ac nos praecinctis' Sat. 1.
5. 5, and Sat. 1. 8. 23 ‘succinctam.'

acernam. Much store was set by
the material and beauty of the table53
see on Sat. 2. 2. 4, Mayor on Juv. S. 1.
137: the favourite wood being the
‘citrus.' Maple is named by Pliny,
N. H. 16. 20, as an inferior material
¹ citro secundum.' It would seem that
the humour consisted in the pretentious
care taken of a second-rate table.

11. gausape. Hor. is imitating Lu-
cilius (20. 1) ‘Purpureo tersit tum latas

It is

gausape mensas.’

13. ut, Attica virgo : like a κανηφόρος
in the rites of Demeter or Athene: cp.
Sat. Ι. 3. 9 ‘velut qui Iunonis sacra
ferret.' The pompous dignity of these
slaves is contrasted with the fussy
activity of the preceding ones: each
is equally inappropriate.

15. maris expers: οὐ τεθαλαττω-
μένον Athen. 1. p. 32; brine was
mingled with Greek wines both sor
the sake of the taste and for whole-
someness. This is the simplest ex-
planation, and it suits Persius⁷ imitation
5. 393 see Conington's note. Why the
usual treatment has been omitted is not
clear. It may be a ‘ fad' of Nasidienus,
or he may wish to make the wine less
drinkable. Various other suggestions
have been made, as (Ι) that ‘maris
expers' means ‘home-made‚' a Greek
wine ‘ that never crossed the sea ’3 (2)
that, as Casaubon took it in Persius,
‘maris’ is from ‘mas‚’ ‘that has lost
its strength‚' ‘ insipid.'

16. The host offers what he does not
expect to be accepted; shows off his
cellar and spares it. ‘Sive' is omitted
before ‘Albanum '; see on Od. 1. 3. 16.

18. divitias miseras. Horace's
comment. ‘What a miserable exhibi-
tion of wealth of the “beatus Nasi-
dienus,'' ostentation with meanness.'

19. pulchre fuerit: see above on v. 4.

laboro: Epp. 1. 3. 20.

20. summus ego. For the placing
of the guests see introd.

Viscus Thurinus, i. e. of Thurii (Od.
