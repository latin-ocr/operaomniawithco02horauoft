Aut flumen Rhenum aut pluvius describitur arcus.

Sed nunc non erat his locus.
Scis simulare:

Et fortasse cupressum

quid hoc, si fractis enatat expes 20

Navibus aere dato qui pingitur? Amphora coepit

Institui ;

currente rota cur urceus exit?

Denique sit quodvis, simplex dumtaxat et unum.
Maxima pars vatum, pater et iuvenes patre digni,

Decipimur specie recti:
Obscurus fio ;

brevis esse laboro, 2 5
sectantem levia nervi

Deficiunt animique3 professus grandia turget;

Serpit humi tutus nimium timidusque p1·0cellae;

Qui variare cupit rem prodigaliter unam,

Delphinum silvis appingit, fluctibus aprum. 30

18. flumen Rhenum. For the form
of the adj. cp. ‘Metaurum flumen' Od.

19. non erat, ‘it is not though you
thought it was ’; see on Od. 1. 37. 4.

cupressum. Porph. vouches for
a Greek proverb μή τι ἐκ κυπαρίσσου
θέλεις; ‘do you want any part of a
cypress?’ which he explains by this
passage, as a question supposed to be
asked by a painter whose sorte lay in
drawing a cypress of a man who had
escaped shipwreck and wished for a
picture osa shipwreck to put as a votive
offering in a temple. It seems not im-
possible that the ‘invisa cupressus' (Od.
2. 14. 23) is thought of as specially in-
appropriate in a picture of escape frorn
death.

20. simulare, μιμεῖσθαιε Epp. 2. 1.

expes: at the moment which is to be
dep icted, viz. when he is swimming for
his life.

21. aere dato qui pingitur. For
the practice of votive pictures cp. Od.
1. 5.13‚ Sat.2.1. 33 n.

amphora eoepit: a metaphor from
another art. The difference between
the wine—jar and the pitcher is of shape,
not material, nor necessarily size. The
figure is of those who in a work of art
cannot keep steadily in view the pur-

ose.

p 23. sit quodvis. Bentley is clearly
right in taking ‘quodvis ⁷ as the predi-
cate, as against those who took it as
subj. ‘let what you desire be,’ etc. It
is, as he says, the conclusion of the

figure of the preceding verse. ‘ In hea-
ven's name let it be what you will—a
pitcherif so you choose-provided only it
be something simple ancl one.’ Whether
to attain this sense it is necessary to
alter with him the ‘quodvis' of all good
MSS. to the slightly supported ‘ quidvis'
is not equally certain. Munro and Ritter
retain the reading of the MSS.

24. maxima pars vatum, ‘most of
us poets.' The mode os expression com—
mends Horace's criticisms‚ certainly as
including himselfwithin their effect, and
possibly as implying that the Pisos also
are among the poets.

25. speeie: see on Sat. 2.
vision of right.’

26. levia, the oppos ‘aspera' Poets‚
in their dread of roughness, polish their
lines till they destroy their vigour and
spirit.

27. professus grandia: cp. ⁶ magna
profcssis,’ V. 14.

28. serpit humi: of one who does
not trust his wings sor poetic ssight:
'sermones . . . Repentes per humum'
Epp. 2. 1. 250. The following words
would not be inappropriate to this
figure, as stormy winds would be one
of the dangers which might srighten
the bird from using its wings (cp Od.
4. 4. 7‘ nimbis remotis '), but in ‘timi-
dus procellae' probably a second fif gure
has come into view, viz.. of the sailor
who hugs the shore ‘dum procellas

Cautus horresc'1[t]' Od. 2. 10. 2.
29, 30. This is the point to which

the other illustrations of the law lead
up. ‘So these ridiculous incongruities
