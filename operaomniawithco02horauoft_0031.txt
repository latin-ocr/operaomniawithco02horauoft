LIB. Ι.

SAT, 1. 19

Sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pulsat. 10
Ille datis vadibus qui rure extractus in urbem est

Solos felices viventes clamat in urbe.

Cetera de genere hoc, adeo sunt multa, loquacem
Delassare valent Fabium. Ne te morer, audi

Quo rem deducam.

Si quis deus, ‘En ego,9 dicat, ¹5

‘Iam faciam quod voltis: eris tu, qui modo miles,
Mercator3 tu, consultus modo, rusticus: hinc vos,
Vos hinc mutatis discedite partibus: eia!

Quid statis ⁷ ? nolint.

Atqui licet esse beatis.

Quid causae est merito quin illis Iuppiter ambas 20

not belong to the Twelve Tables or to the
legislative powers of the comitia. It is
used sor processes of law, ‘in ius ire,’
‘ iure agere.y In such cases as the present
(cp. Epp. 1. 16. 41 ⁴ qui consulta patrum
qui leges iuraque servat') the conjunc-
tion is intended to express ‘law on all
its sides!

10. sub galli cantum, ‘ at cock-
crOW,' an exaggeratio-11, as when Cicero
is laughing at the ‘iurisconsultiff pro
Mur. 9. 22 ‘ Vigilas tu de nocte
ut tuis consultoiibus respondeas, ille
(the soldier) ut eo quo intendit ma-
ture cum exercitu perveniat3 te gal-
lorum, illum buccinarum cantus exsus-
citat.'

11. ille, δεικτικῶς. That poor sel'low.

datis vadibus, lit. ‘having named
sureties! The person who had done so
was bound, ‘ respondere vadato . . . quod
si non fecisset, perdere litem’ Sat. 1. 9.

13. cetera de genere hoo, τὰ ἄλλα
τοιαῦτα, a Lucretiam formula, 4. 590,
etc.

14. Fabium. ‘Fabius maximus,
Narbonensis, equestri loco natus Pom-
peianas partes secutus aliquot libros ad
Stoicam philosophiam pertinentes con·
scripsit’ Porph. His name rccurs in
Sat. 1. 2. 134. He seems to be a
Stoical teacher whom Horace is ridi-
culing as he does Crispinus in these
same Satires.

15. quo rem deducam. The ‘sum
of the whole matter,' the conclusions to
which what 1 have said so far has been
leading. ‘ All this desire of change is
unreal. They would not change if they
could.'

si quis deus: the thought is re-

peated in Sat. 2. 7. 24 ‘Si quis ad illa
deus subito te agat usque recuses.’

en ego . . . iam faciam. We need
not separate the two clauses grammati-
cally. ‘ See, here am Ι ! I will‚' etc. 1t
is one sentence, but each word gives its
own colour to it. ‘En’ calls atten—
tion to the speaker: ‘ego,‘ the em-
phatic pronoun, gives the assurance
that the promise can be sulfflled, ‘ you
have the word osa g0d1' ‘ia1n‚' ‘this
moment.’

17. consultuS, absol. = ‘ iurisconsul-
tus‚' as Epp. 2. 2. 87, 159. Heindorf
points out that ‘rusticus’ is certainly
the pred. 1t was the lawyer who had
wished (v. 8) to be a countryman. The
countryman had only wished to live in
town.

hinc hine. It is a complete
metaphor from the theatre. They are
bidden to change their parts and ac-
cordingly to change their places on the
stage.

18. eia! ‘Quiekl’ ‘move on.' So
Sat, 2. 6. 23 ‘Eia‚ Ne prior officio quis—
quam respondeat urge.’ It stands after
the imperatives as here in Virg. Aen.
9. 38 ‘Feute citi ferrum, date tela, ascen—
dite muros Hostis adest, eia ξ’

19. nolint. The construction re·
turns to a proper apodosis to ‘ si
quis deus . . . ‹licat' V. 15, aster the
interruption caused by the momentary
continuance of the dramatis form ⁴ quid
statis' 2

lieet, esse beatis, for the dat. cp.
