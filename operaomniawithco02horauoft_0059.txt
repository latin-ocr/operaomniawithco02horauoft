LIB. Ι.

SAT. 3. 47

Cur optas quod habes? ‘Non nosti quid pate1¹,' inquit,
‘ Chrysippus dicat: Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam

Nec soleas fecit, sutor tamen est sapiens.'

‘Qui?’

‘Ut quamvis tacet Hermogenes cantor tamen atque

Optimus est modulator; ut Alfenus vafer, omni

¹30

Abiecto instrumento artis clausaque taberna,
Tonsor erat, sapiens operis sic optimus omnis
Est opifex solus, sic rex.' Vellunt tibi barbam
Lascivi pueri3 quos tu nisi fuste coerces

Urgeris turba circum te stante miserque

135

Rumperis et latras, magnorum maxime regum.
Ne longum faciam: dum tu quadrante lavatum
Rex ibis neque te quisquam stipator ineptum

Praeter Crispinum sectabitur, et mihi dulces

126. pater, in the sense in which
Cic. (N. D. 2. 9. 33) calls Zeno ‘ Stoi-
corum 133101] It is a Stoic speaking.

127. Chrysippus: Sat. 2. 3. 44, 2. 3.
287; Epp. 1. 2. 43 the second founder
of Stoicism; εἰμὴ ἧν Χρύσιππος οὐκ ἂν
ἧν Στοά, Diog. Laert. 7. 183. Ηο was
born at Soli in Cilicia, Β. C. 280, and
died in 207.

crepidas, soleas, the Greek and the
Roman slippers.

128. sapiens: the subj. repeated and
in the emphatic place is meant to be
characteristic. The Stoic is for ever
talking of the ‘ sapiens.'

129. Hermogenes: see introd. to
this Satire.

130. Alfenus. There is an Alfenus
Varus, a ‘iurisconsultus' of eminence,
of whose legal writings there are ex-
cerpts in the Digest. The Scholiasts on
this place say that Horace is speaking
of him, that he was a native of Cremona
and practised there as a ‘tonsor’ (ace.
to one MS.) or as a ‘sutor' (acc. to the
othersl, that he removed to Rome and
became the pupil of Servius Sulpicius,
and eventually {amous in the law.
VVhethcr the identification is right there
is nothing to show.

132. tonsor. This was the original
reading of V, and it is supported by
one MS. of Acron’s note. Other MSS.
have ‘ sutor.’ Bentley argues strongly
for ‘ tonsor‚' on the ground that Horace’s
thesis is that the wise man is a cobbler;
he is illustrating this from other arts,

that of the singer and the barber. It
would be dull to take an instance of the
very art in question; ‘tonsor' is given
by Munro and Ritter.

133. vellunt, perh. with Heindorf
‘ are plucking ’ all the time that you are
declaiming on the royalty of the wise
man.

barbam: affected by philosophers;
Sat. 2. 3. 35 ‘sapientem pascere bar-
hams Juv. Sat. 14. 1 2 ‘ barbatos . . magis-
tros.’

134. fuste, also appropriate: cp.
Apul. Inst. 11. 8 ‘ qui pallio, baculoque,
et baxeis, et hircino barbitio philoso-
phiam fingeret.⁷

136. rumperis (sc. ‘ira ³) et, latras z
the picture of impotent rage, with allu-
sion to the title ‘Cynic'; cp. Epp. Ι.
17. 18 ‘ mordacem Cynicum.’

137. quadrante, the customary price
at the public baths, cp. Sen. Epist.
86 ‘ balneum res quadrantaria.'

138. stipator, the proper term for
one of a royal suite.

139. Crispinum: Sat. 1. 1. 120.

et, answered by ⁶ que ’ in v. 141. This
passage is quoted by Madv. on Cic. de
Fin. 5. 22. 64 ‘quis est quin intelligat
et eos qui fecerint dignitatis splendore
ductos immemores fuisse utilitatum
suarum, nosque cum ea laudemus nulla
alia re nisi honestate duci.' He holds
them as rare instances of a careless junc-
ture of clauses.
