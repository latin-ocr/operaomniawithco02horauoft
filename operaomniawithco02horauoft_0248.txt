HORATII EPISTULARUM

Curantem quicquid dignum sapiente bonoque est? 5

Non tu corpus eras sine pectore.

Di tibi formam,

Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.

Quid voveat dulci nutricula maius alumno,

Qui sapere et fari possit quae sentiat, et cui

Gratia, fama, valetudo contingat abunde, ¹0
Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena?

Inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras,

Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum:

Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora.

Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises 15
Cum ridere voles Epicuri de grege porcum„

vivere silvis, Qua nulla humano sit via
trita pede.'

reptare, of leisurely strolling.

6. eraS. The time is explained by
the emphasis laid in v. 2 on ‘nunc.'
Horaee's ground for being sure that
Tibullus is now either busy on good
poetry or living as a philosopher, is his
previous knowledge of him. See note
on Od. 1. 37. 4. This instance comes
under (2). ‘I thought so when Ι knew
you and I was right.’

pectore, used as ‘cor‚’ ‘animus’
Ovid has ‘rudis et sine pectore’ Met.
13. 290.

formam. In two lives of the poet
prefixed to MSS. of his poems he is de-
scribed as ‘ insignis forma!

7. divitias: the word, as Dissen re·
remarks in his introd. to Tibullus, is
explained in v. 11 by ‘mundus victus
non deficiente crumena,' and so recon-
ciled to what Tibullus himselfrepea‘cedly
says of his circumstance& He speaks
of having a reduced estate, small but
sufficient : ‘paupertas’ 1. 1. 5, ‘ compo-
sito securus acervo Despiciam dites de-
spiciamque famem’ 1. 1. 77, but ‘ riches ’
is a relative term.

dederunt : Epod. 9. 17 ‘ verterim&
Sat. 1. 10. 45 ‘annuerunt.' Some MSS.
have ‘ dederant.'

8. voveat, in the sense of ‘to pray
sor‚' as ‘votum ’ frequently.

nutricula. For a foster-mother's
prayers ep. Pers. Sat. 2. 37 ‘Ego nu-
trici non mando vota‚’ etc.

9. quj. The constr. is quite straight-
forward. ‘ What more should a fond
foster-mother desire for a dear child
who already can,‘ etc. ⁴? This was missed‚

and some comparative constr. after
‘ maius ' looked for 3 and the result was
the variant ‘ quam,' which with the inter-
polation ‘ut’ before ⁴ possit’ occupied
the early editions. Some good MSS.
have ‘ quin.'

sapere et fari. Obbar recalls Thuc.
2. 60 ’γνῶναί τε τὰ δέοντα καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι
ΤαίΙΤα-

11. mundus: illustrated by Od. 3.
29. 14, Sat. 2. 2. 65, and the opposue
‘ pauperies, immunda domus ’ Epp. 2. 2.
199· . ‚

12. inter, etc.‚ ‘ 1n a world of; where
others, who are not philosophers are
tossed by divers passion5‚ do you hold
fast the secret of tranquillity. ι

13. omnem erede. Another version
of such precepts as ‘ Quem fors dierum
cunque dabit, lucro Appone’ Od31. 9.
14, and ‘ carpe diem quam minimum
credula postero ’ Od. 1. 11. 8.

14. superveniet: come as a welcome
surprise. · ι

15, me, in its emphatic position
points the argument, ‘ Ι practise what 1
preaeh '; at the same time when speaklng
of himself Horace with his usual lrony
puts Epicureanism in a playful aspect.-

pinguem, an actual feature m
Horaee’s case acc. to the Suetonian lise,
‘ habitu corporis brevis suit atque obesus!

metaphor for a ‘ school ’ of philosophy,
but here it is intended to suit, and as
Prof. wilkins says to lighten gby the fact
that it is an habitual figure), the meta-
phor of ⁶ porcum.’ ‘ Epicurus' sty'
would turn play into eamest.
