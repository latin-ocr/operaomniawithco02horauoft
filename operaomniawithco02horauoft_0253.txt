EPISTLE VI.

TO NUMICIUS.

‘ C HOOSE your “summum bonum '⁷ and having chosen ilpursue it wz'tlz tlzorouglz-
ness and consz'stency.' One who says this has his own idea of the true ‘ summum
bonurn,' and the illustrations of his principle in the case of ideals other than this
must be in some degree ironical.

Verses 1, 2. Assume the ‘ summum bonum ⁷ to be the ἀταραξία of the Epicureans.

3-16. Τ11611, 566 all that follows from this and remember (17-27) how the absurdity
of overestimating sublunary things is pointed by the instability os human life.

28-31. So with all ideals. You are energetic in trying to cure a pain in your side
or back. Be the same in moral things.

If virtue is the one road to happiness, make any sacrifices for her.

31—48. If on the contrary there is no standard but a material one, then pursue with
energy material wealth.

49—55. If the objects of ambition give happiness, spare no pains on them.

56—64. If good eating, then take the shortest roads to that.

65, 66. If love and mirth, think os nothing else than them.

67, 68. These are my principles, Numicius3 tell me srankly if you have any better
ones,

Note that the phrases which give the connection are v. 2 ⁴ facere et servare
beatum,' v. 29 ‘recte vivere‚' v. 47 ‘facere et servare beatum,’ v. 49 ‘fortu-
natum praestat‚’ v. 56 ‘bene vivit,’ v. 66 ‘vivas in. ...' all expressions of the

‘ summum bonum ' or ideal of life.

In speaking of the philosophica] idea of ἀταραξία identified with ἀθαυμαστία (see
on v. Ι), vv. 1-27‚ the key-words are ‘ admirari ⁷ v. 1, ‘ miratur’ v. 9, ‘ mirare ' v. 18,
⁶ mirabilis ' v. 24.

We have no clue to the identity of Numicius. The Scholiasts are silent about
him.

ΝΠ, admirari prope res est una, Numici,
Solaque, quae possit facere et servare beatum.
Hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certis

1. Nil admirari: cp. Strabo’s words prope, ‘ is perhaps the one and only
(1. 3. 21) τὴν ἀθαυμαστίαν ἣν ὑμνεῖ thing.' See on Sat. 2. 3. 32 ‘stultique
Δημόκριτος καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι φιλόσοφοι πάντες ; prope omnes,' and cp. A. P. 432 ‘ faciunt
παράκειται ’γὰρ τῷ ἀθαμβεΐ καὶ ἀταράχῳ prope plura.'
καὶ ἀνεκπλήκτῳ, and Cicero, de Fin. una solaque. Cicero prefers ‘unus
5. 29. 87 ‘Id enim ille [Democritus] solus’without the conjunction, and uses
summum bonurn εὐθυμίαν 61 saepe ἀθαμ- 11 frequently. ‘ Una,' = ‘ praecipua.'
βίαν appellat, id est animum terrore 11- Notice the additional force given by
berum.⁷ Μηδὲν θαυμάζειν 15 a precept or dividing ‘ una' from ‘ solaque‚' and by
a boast attributed to philosophers of the insertion between them of the voca-
several schools, but Horace is likely to tive which asks for special attention.
be thinking chiefly of the ἀταραξία of the 3. hunc solem, ‘ yonder sun.'
Epicureans.
