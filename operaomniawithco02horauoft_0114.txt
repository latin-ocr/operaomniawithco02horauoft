HORATII SATIRARUM

‘At sermo lingua concinnus utraque

Cum versus facias, te ipsum percontor, an et cum 25

23. concinnus. 1n our ignorance of
the etymology of this word it is impos-
sible to say whether any metaphor is
felt. Nonius Marcellus (a grammarian
of uncertain date) derives it from ‘ cin-
nuS,’ the name of a drink, like the Ho-
meric κυκεών, os meal and wine. If this
was believed in Horace's time it would
suit the similitude of the following
verse.

utraque: see on Od. 3. 8. 5.

24. nota: see on Od. 2. 3. S. ‘ chi0‚'
‘ Falerni‚' a Greek and an Italian wine.

25. ‘ Is that a principle which you con-
fine to the criticism of poetry, or would
you apply it also to oratory, and to
oratory of a serious kind? ’

te ipsum, ‘ Ι press the question home
to yourself‚ give me your own experi-
ence.’

26. eausa Petilli stands, generally,
sor a case where much is at stake and
where the defence is difficult: see on
Sat. Ι. 4. 94.

27 soll. ‘Doubtless you would forget
fatherland and father and prefer, whilst
Pedius Publicola and Corvinus spend
their strength in pleading in pure Latin,
to adulterate your mother speech with
foreign words like a double-tongued
Canusian.’ Ι have followed Orelli,
though with some doubt, in giving ‘ La-
tine.' It is found in some good MSS.
(φ, ψ, λ, 1), although the majority read
‘ Latini.y Cruquius himself preferred it
against all his MSS. as the reading,
though not of V, of the marginal anno-
tator on V, who wrote ‘ cum exsudet, id
est, cum sudore et omni instantia Latine
recitet, Latine p1·oferat.‘ The scholia
of Aer. and Porph. point the same way,
though their argument is not quite lo-
gical, as they both dwell on the fact that
the two orators named were purists in
respect of Latin words. As Orelli re—
marks, the corruption of ‘Latine' to
‘Latini’ to suit ‘patris‘ is easy to
imagine—easier than the reverse altera*
tion. If with Bentley we read ⁴ Latini’
we may either take it as an adj.‚ as

Virgil’s ‘genus Latinum' Aen. 1. 6, or (as
he prefers) of Latinus (‘ pater Latinus’
in Virg. Aen. 7. 61, ete), as the eponym-
ous ancestor of the Latin speaking race.
Cp. in that case, with the whole expres-
sion, Od. 3. 5. 10, 11. Latinus’ name is
not so used anywhere else. With this
reading the obvious mode of construct-
ing ‘intermiscere' is to suppose a sub-
ject ‘eos‚’ sc. ‘Pedium et Messallam.'
Bentley, to make the sentence run more
smoothly, altered ‘oblitus' to ⁴ oblitos’
to agree with this subject—and he is
followed by Ritter and Munro. I arn
not sure that it is not open to Orelli's
objection that, although ‘ oblitus patriae}
etc. is in place as forcibly putting the
crime of the person addressed, it occu·
pies too emphatic a position if it be-
comes the hypothetical description not
even of what these orators were, but of
what the person addressed might prefer
them to be.

28. Pedius . . . Publicola atque Cor-
vinus. Corvinus is the M. Valerius

Messalla Corvinus of Od. 3. 21. 7 (seev

introd. to that Odel, Sat. 1. 6. 42, A. P.
371 ‘diserti Messallae! Who Pedius
was is uncertain. The Seholiasts say
that he and Corvinus were brothers.
This may be illustrated by, or may be
due to, v. 85 ‘te, Messalla, tuo curn
fratre,' where they annotate ‘ sc. Publi-
eola,’ but see on that verse. That the
two families were connected is known
from Pliny (N. H. 35. 7) who states that
Q. Pedius, the nephew of C. Julius
Caesar, was married into the family of
Messalla. Their grandson was a deaf-
mute who, by Messalla's advice, was
taught the art of painting. This is all
that is known. It has been conjectured,
but on no further grounds, that Q. Pe-
dius the younger, the father os the deas-
mute, adopted his cousin's son, a brother
of Messalla the orator, who therefore
became ‘Pedius' Doubt hangs also
over the name ‘ Publicola.’ Estre joins
it with ‘Corvinus‚' quoting as parallel
‘optimus atque Cocceius ‘ Sat. 1. 5. 27,
