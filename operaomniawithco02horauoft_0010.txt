vi PREFACE.

of Horace in giving them for the first time a clear and
trustworthy conspectus of the evidence of value which
is at our command. But it has not produced a general
agreement, either with their method of grouping the
MSS. in classes or families, or with their particular
estImate of the value of Cruquius' Old Blandinian
MS. (V) 1. Cruquius no doubt overestimated its
antiquity; but, on the other hand, the more the question
has been sisted the less reason there has appeared
to be for doubting the care and bona fides of his
testimony, and the more reason for assenting to the
general judgrnent of scholars from Bentley downwards,
that we have access in its readings to a text, not
necessarily always right, but of unique value as
exhibiting a tradition independent of the other MSS.
In addition to the Editors whose help Ι have
acknowledged before, I have of course leant greatly
in the Satires on Heindorf (re-edited by Wusteman,
Leipzig, 1843) and in the First Book of the Epistles on
Obbar (Leipzig, 1837). I have made great use of the
thoughtful and independent commentary of Scht'1tz
(Berlin, 1883), and have derived many suggestions from
the edition of the Satires by Prof. A. Palmer and that
of the Epistles by Prof. Wilkins (Macmillan, 1884 and
1885). Ι have come also to estimate very highly the
compressed but singularly complete and sensible notes

¹ Ι would refer especially to the examination of Keller's conclusions by
l‘. Hoehn (((16 codice Bland. antiquissi1no‚' Jena, 1883) and W. Mewes
(the editor of the re-issue of Orelli, ‘Ueber den wert des Cod. Bland.
vetustissimus,⁷ Berlin, 1882); also to Professor Nettleship‚ ‘Essays in
Latin Lite1·ature‚' p. 188 f.
