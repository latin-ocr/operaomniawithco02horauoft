LIB. II.

Verba facit leno :

SAT. 3. 153

‘Quicquid mihi, quicquid et horum

Cuique domi est, id crede tuum et vel nunc pete vel cras.'‘
Accipe quid contra iuvenis responderit aequus:
‘ In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus ut aprum

Cenem ego ;

tu pisces hiberno ex aequore verris.

235

Segnis ego, indignus qui tantum possideam: aufer:

Sume tibi decies;

tibi tantumdem ;

tibi triplex

Unde uxor media currit de nocte vocata?
Filius Aesopi detractam ex aure Metellae,

Scilicet ut decies solidum absorberet, aceto

Diluit insignem bacam: qui sanior ac si

Illud idem in rapidum flumen iaceretve cloacam?
Quinti progenies Arri, par nobile fratrum,
Nequitia et nugis pravorum et amore gemellum,

Luscinias soliti impenso prandere coemptam,

233- aequus, ‘just and generous.‘
The irony is the same as in Sat. 1. 2. 4
¹ quippe benignus erat.’

234. in nive dormis: cp. Od. 1. 1.
25—28. Bentley wished to read ‘Tu'
for ‘ In.' An emphatic ‘ Tu’ is omitted
in a similar way in v. 212.

Lucana: ‘ Lucanus aper ⁹ Sat. 2. 8. 6.

235. verris, with a sweep-net, σαγήνη,
‘everriculum,' a word used metaphori-
cally by Cicero, who applies it to
Verres plundering his province, Verr. 2.
4. 24. There is an alternative reading
(given by Holder) ‘vellis‚’ of consider-
able MS. authority and interpreted by
the Pseudo-Aen, though he adds ‘alii
verris.' The Blandinian MSS. all had
‘ verris.' ⁶ Vellis ³ must imply catching
with a line. ‘ Hiberno ex aequore ’ would
be hyperbolical. Orelli questions the
use of ‘vellere,’ and no parallel is
quoted.

236. tantum. ‘all this fortune.’

237. decies, i.e. ‘centena milia ses-
tertiorum‚’ ‘ a million.’

239. filius Aesopi. The story of
this mad freak is repeated by Pliny
N. H. 9. 59. 35 (at the same time with
the story of Cleopatra and the pearl l, with
the addition that, having swallowed the
pearl himself, he provided one each for
his guests also. Aesopus is the famous
tragic actor, the friend of Cicero ; see on
Epp. 2. 1. 82. Pliny gives the name of
the young man as Clodius! Valerius
Maximus (9. 1. 2) speaks of him as

‘non solum perditae sed etiam furiosae
luxuriae? ‘ Metella ’ is not identified, nor
is it essentia] to the story. It is an in-
genious conjecture, accepted by many
editors, that she was the Caecilia Me-
tella who was divorced by P. Corn.
Lentulus Spinther, and with whom Dola-
bella, Cicero's son-in-law, intrigued.
Prof. Palmer suggests that Cicero's
‘ Filius Aesopi’ (he notices the verbal
coincidence) ‘ me excruciat' (ad Att.
13. 15. 3) was connected with these in-
trigueS.

240. solidum, sc. ‘integrum‚' Aer.
‘decies ' (see above, v. 237) being treated
as a neut. subst., ‘a million entire—at
one gulp ’3 so Martial 4. 37. 4 ‘tricies
soldum.'

241. bacam, ‘a pearl.'
to the Roman jeweller occupied the
place of the diamond in modern times.

qui : above on v. 108.

24²· iaceretve: above on v. 130.

243. Nothing is known of the bro-
thers. They would seem to be sons of
the Arrius mentioned above in v. 86.

par, ⁶ a well-matched pair’3 see on
Sat. 1. 7. 19.

244. gemellum: cp. Epp.1. 10. 3.
Cicero has‘ geminum in scelere par'
lhil. 11. 1. 2.

245. luscinias. Their proper plea-
sure is sor the ear, as that of the pearl
was for the eye, not for the taste The
two stories are parallel not only as cases
of insane extrmagance, but of extra-
