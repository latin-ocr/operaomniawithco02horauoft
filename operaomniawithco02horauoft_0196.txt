HORATII SATIRARUM

O ruS‚ quando ego te adspiciam? quandoque licebit 60
Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno et inertibus horis,
Ducere sollicitae iucunda oblivia vitae?

O quando faba Pythagorae cognata simulque

Uncta satis pingui ponentur oluscula lardo?

O noctes cenaeque deum! quibus ipse meique 65
Ante Larem proprium vescor vernasque procaces

Pasco libatis dapibus.

Prout cuique libido est

Siccat inaequales calices conviva, solutus
Legibus insanis, seu quis capit acria fortis

Pocula seu modicis uvescit laetius.

of ‘perdo' On which account Lachmann
would alter it, suggesting ‘porgitur,'
others ‘ proditur.'

votis 2 illustrated in the aspirations of
vv. 60-65.

61. veterum libris. What books
they would be we may see in Sat. 2. 3.
11, Epp. 1. 2.1.

somno: Od.1.1. 20, Epp.1.14.35.

62. ducere: Od. Ι. 17. 21. The
metaphor is evidently from the ‘ waters
of Lethe)

oblivia, the draughts that make us
forget.

vitae, the gen. obj.

63. faba Pythagorae cognata. For
the allusion cp. Epp. 1. 12. 21 n., and
Juv. S. 15. 173. ‘ Pythagoras cunctis ani-
malibus abstinuit qui Tanquam homine,
et ventri indulsit non omne legumen‚’
with Mayor’s exhaustive note. The
reference is to the Pythagorean proverb
κυάμων ἀπέχεσθαι Diog. Laeit. 8. 18.
It is one osa series of short rules on
diet, some of which were generally in-
terpreted literally, some as metaphors.
Cicero mentions it (de Div. 1. 30. 62)
‘Pythagoricis interdictum ne faba vesce-
rentur,’ and explains it ‘ quod habet
inflationem magnam is cibus, tranquilli-
tati mentis quaerentis vera contrariam.'
Many other fanciful reasons are given.
The ground given in the text> connecting
it with the doctrine of metempsychosis,
as though in eating a bean you might be
unconsciously eating a kinsman, whether
it be an original jest of Horace’s or not,
suits well with the tone ofamused interest
with which he habitually refers to the
Pythagorean school. See introd. to Od.
1. 28, and cp. also his treatment of an—
other Pythagorean proverb in Sat. 2. 3.

Ergo 70

276. The immediate purpose of the
allusion in this place is to give a hu-
morous exaltation to the vegetable
which Horace appreciates: Pythagoras
honoured itin one way: Horace honours
it in another.

64. satis, with uncta. For the
dish cp. Sat. 2. 2. 116 ‘olus fumosae
cum pede pernae.'

65. mei, the guests; his easy relation
to whom he describes in the following
verses.

66. proeaees, ‘ saucy.’ He is paint-
ing the freedom and homeliness of his
establishment. Cp. the similar scene in
Epod. 2. 65 ‘ Positosque vernas . . . Cir-
cum renidentes Lares!

67. libatis (Virg. Aen. 5. 92 ‘Liba-
vitque dapes), ⁴ tasted‚' i. e. from the
master's table, and with plenty still left
for the slaves} The word denotes the
moderation of the meal.

prout, a monosyll.‚ as ‘quoad ’ Sat. 2.
3. 1.

38. inaequales, i.e. mixed in differ-
ent proportions, as explained in the fol—
lowing line. See on Od. 3. 19. 11.

solutus legibus insanis: see on
Sat. 2. 2. 123.

70. uvescit. Cp. the adj. ‘uvidus'
in Od. 2. 19. 18, 4. 5. 39.

ergo, ‘and so'3 as in Epod. 2. 9,
there is slight illative force. The free-
dom to talk of what is interesting is
part and parcel of the absence of other
foolish conventionalities. With the pic-
ture of the conversation on high matters
which gives its flavour to the simple
feast cp. the words of Lucilius quoted
by Cic. de Fin. 2. 8. 24 ‘Condito
sermone bono,’ evidently in the same
connection.
