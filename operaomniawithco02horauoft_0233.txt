EPIST. 1.

An qui Fortunae te responsare superbae ·

Liberum et erectum praesens hortatur et aptat?

Quodsi me populus Romanus forte roget, cur 70
Non ut porticibus sic iudiciis fruar isdem,

Nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit,

Olim quod volpes aegroto cauta leoni

Respondit referam: ‘Quia me vestigia terrent,

Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.' 75
Belua multorum es capitum. Nam quid sequar aut quem?
Pars hominurn gestit conducere publica, sunt qui

Frustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras,

- Esscipiantque senes quos in vivaria mittant3

Multis occulto crescit res fenore.

68. responsare: see on Sat. 2. 7. 85.

69. ereetum. Orelli compares Cic.
Deiot. 13. 36 ‘ magno animo et erecto
est, nec unquam succumbet inimicis, ne
fortunae quidem.‘

praesens : much as it is used ofdivini-
ties, ‘with ready help‚' ‘in hour of
need ' 3 it goes with both verbs: he not
only advises but helps you to keep the
advice.

aptat. A few good MSS. (incl. Regin.)
‘ optat.’ There is the reverse mistake
in Epp. 1. 6. 55, some old MSS. reading
‘ adapta)

71. porticibus: see Sat. 1. 4. 134n.

fruar: not only use, but ‘use with
pleasure.’

73. olim, as in Sat. 2. 6. 79,
‘ once upon a time ' ofa fable. Cp. Epp.
1.3. 18. Itis an Aesopean fable. Porph-
tells us that Lucilius had used it, and
some of the lines in which he did so
have been pieced together in his frag-
ments, 30. 80 foll. ed. Mulier, cp. esp.
vv. 86, 87 ‘Quid sibi volt, quare fit ut
introversus et ad te Spectent atque ferant
vestigia se omnia prorsus?

76. belua multorum capitum.
Horace dwells on the figure of the fable
and gives another aspect to it. The
world which bids me imitate it is well
represented as a beast—a beast,like those
of legend, with many heads.

77-80. We are passing from the
charge brought against the world, ofa
wrong standard, to that of inconstancy,
but this· is not done with logical accuracy‚
and the instances given of variety of
taste in different people belong still to

the

Verum 80

the old subject, being limited to various
ways, including the most questionable
ones, of making money.

77. conducere publiea, ‘ to take pub-
lic contracts.' The phrase seems to cover
contracts both for the farming of the
revenue (cp. ‘ publicis male redemptis'
Cic. Q. Frat. 1. 1. ΙΙ) and sor works to
be executed for the state. It is possible
that Horace is thinking ofvarious grades
of dignity in such contracts (cp. Juvenal's
‘ Quis facile est aedem conducere, flu-
mina, portus, Siccandam eluviem‚' etc.
3. 30), but the main irony lies in the
verb ‘ gestit,’ ‘is greedy t0,' and in the
juxtaposition of the calling of the ‘ pub-
licanus’ with that of the legacy-hunter
and the money-lender‚ as though the
difference were one of taste.

78. frustis : Perhaps acontemptuous
term; ‘ scraps,' ‘ broken meat,’ of such
presents as the ‘turdus' of Sat. 2. 5. 10.
Most editors have preferred the reading
‘ crustis ’ (ί ealcesss ‘pastry ⁷ ; cp. the
dim. ‘crustula ' in Sat. 1. 1. 25), which
Cruquius and Lambinus found in some os
their MSS. and which has the authority
of σ (the St. Gall MS).

pomis: Sat. 2. 5. 12.

venentur . . . excipiant z Od. 3. 12.
12 ‘ excipere aprum.'

79. vivaria, of catching wild game
and turning them into preserveS. Cp. the
similar metaphor of catching fish and
putting them in fishponds, Sat. 2. 5. 44.

80. occulto. It is difficult to choose
between the interpretations ‘secret,' i.e.
unlawful, and therefore not arranged in
public, and ‘the interest that grows, men
