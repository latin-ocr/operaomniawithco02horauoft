HORATII ARS POETICA. 389

347—359. Do not suppose Ι expect an impossible perfection‚ but I draw a dis-
tinction between the bad poet who is occasionally good, and the good poet
who is, if so be, occasionally less good.

360—365. There is in poetry as in painting a difference between aimS, between
a sketch and a finished picture.

366—373. Only remember one thing is intolerable in poetry, though allowable in
most things,—mediocrity.

374-384. If poetry is not good it is bad, and we are better without it. We
forget this too often.

385-390. Do you remember it. Do not write unless you are in the vein. What

you write submit to some good critic, and do not be in a hurry to publish it.

391-407. Poetry has had historically a high mission.

thought scorn of.

It is not a thing to be

408—415. People ask sometimes which is necessary to a poet, natural gifts or

artistic training. The answer is, both.

You need the gist; but the gift

without training will do no more in this art than in any other.
416—437. You can wrap yourself up in your conceit, or you can buy applause from
interested critics ; but you know how wortlrless this is and will beware of it.

The poem ends with the picture-—

438—45 2. First, of the honest and good critic, such as was Quintilius.
453—476. Secondly, of the sels-willed and sels—conceited poet.

HUMANO capiti cervicem pictor equinam
Iungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas
Undique collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum
Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne,

1—9. In this picture of incongruous and
impossible conceptions, Horace had
probably in mind Plato's figure Phaedr.
p. 264 e ἀλλὰ τόδε ’γε οἶμαί σε φάναι ἄν,
δεῖν πάντα λόγον ὥσπερ ζῶον συνεστάναι
σῶμά τι ἔχοντα αὐτὸν αὑτοῦ, ὥστε μήτε
ἀκέφαλον εἶναι μήτε ἄπουν ἀλλὰ μέσα τε
ἔχειν καῖ ἄκρα πρέποντ’ ἀλλήλοις καὶ τῷ
ὅλῳ γεγραμμένα.

2. velit: the verb perhaps implies
the sels-willed fancy of the painter.

inducere plumas . . . membris, ‘to
clothe with feathers, limbs,' etc.‚ ‘ mem-
bris ' being the dat.

varias: i. e. from different birds, as
‘ undique ’ = from every animal3 cp.
Od. 1. 16. 14 ‘particulam undique De-
sectam.' Bentley complained of the
monster as too monstrous, and seeks
to lessen its monstrosity by substituting
‘ fortnas’ for ‘ plumas.’ But the com-
pleteness belongs to the satire. The
monster combines the special charac-
teristics of each division of the animal
kingdom, of man, quadrupeds, birds,
fishes. even of every species in each.
The idea is suggested perhaps by such

pictures as Virgil's of Scylla (Aen. 3.
426), and the Triton (Aen. 10. 211
‘Frons hominem praefert, in pristin
desinit alvus ⁸), and still more by Lu-
cretius⁷ solemn argument (5. 878 f.)
against the possibility of such composite
natures ‘ex alienigenis membris eom-
pacta '3 but Horace is thinking here not
of a monster which poets have imagined,
but osan unimaginable one, which yet,
he would have us think, is no bad
image of the delirious and impossible
conceptions of contemporary poets.

turpiter: it may be doubted whe-
ther the adv. qualifies desinat (⁴ have
ugly ending'), or atrum (⁴ black and
ugly')‚ as ‘turpiter hirtum‘ Epp. 1. 3.
22. This reference does not settle the
question, for in sense ‘turpiter’ there
qualifies ‘ incultum ' as well; it belongs
to the sentence. It is a mistake pro-
bably in such a case to suppose that
the poet himself would necessarily have
wished to resolve our doubts certainly.
