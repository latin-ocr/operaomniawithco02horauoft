plays. In one passage he indicates a
triple division*‚ namely in the letter
(ad Q. Fr. 1. 1. 16), in which he urges
his brother to make the third and last
year of his government, after the example
of good poets and careful amors, the
best, ‘tanquam tertium actum.' This
looks like a return to the Aristotelian
(triple) division, viz. the πρόλογος or
opening, the ἐπεισόδια or body of the
play, and the ἔξοδος or conclusion. The
use of the figure in de Sen. 2. 5 of old
age, ‘extremum actum tanquam ab inerti
poeta esse neglectum,' where only two
previous stages, ‘ pueritia ' and ‘ adoh s-
centia ³ have been distinguished, points
the same way though less decidedly.
On the other hand Verr. Act 2. 2. 6. 18

futurus esset} sc. ‘in the next act.'
three having been just enunieiated,
looks as if he were using ‘ actus’ in the
Horatian sense and contemplating the
fuller number. The division of Roman
comedies (in which there are no choruses)
into five acts rests on other grounds, and
seems to have been the work, often ar-
bitmry, of grammarians. It is first found
in the introductions to Terence's plays by
Donatus (4th cent.). See Ussing's Plautus,
Prolegomena V.

quinto actu: for ‘quam quintum
actum,’ the accusative of extent with
productior.

190. spectata : K. and H. give ‘ spee—
tanda ' as having the best MS. authority,
including that of Β, The variation is
as old as the Schol. Aer. recognizes it

’ ‘ spectanda, alii spectata.’ The Comm.
Cruq. interprets ‘spectata' by ‘pro-
bata! The balance of sense is for
‘spectata.' At the same time ‘spec-
tanda reponi' went temptingly together
(cp. Sat. 1. 10. 39 ‘nec redeant iterum
spectanda theatris’) if a doubt between
the two forms arose. There is the same
hesitation of MSS. in the place just
quoted; also, as Keller points out, in
Epp. 2. 2. 143 between ‘modulanda'
and ‘ modulata!

191. deus, sc. ‘ ex machina,’ ἀπὸ
μηχανῆς, the god appearing in the air
by means of the stage list, in order to
solve an otherwise insoluble plot. The
device was a favourite one with Euri-
pides. Aristode, with his severe ideas
about the plot, was inclined to condemn
such solutions altogether as inartistic:
Poet. 15. 7 φανερὸν οὖν ὅτι καὶ τὰς
λύσεις τῶν μύθων ἐξ αὐτοῦ δεῖ τοῦ μύθου
συμβαίνειν καῖ μὴ ὥσπερ ἐν τῇ Μηδείᾳ
ἀπὸ μηχανῆς. Ι-Ι6 allows supernatural
intervention in solving difficulties outside
the dramatic action of the play, as by
revealing things past which the actors
do not know or things future which they
cannot know. But the practice of poets
was the other way. Cp. Plato, Crat. p.
425 D ὥσπερ οἱ τραγῳδοποιοὶ ἐπειδάν τι
ἀπορῶσιν ἐπὶ τὰς μηχανὰς καταφεύγουσι
θεοὺς αἴροντες, Cic. de Nat D. Ι. 20. 53
‘ut tragici poetae cum explicare argu-
menti exitus non potestis confugitis ad
deum.' More illustrations may be seen
in Orelli's note.

191, ¹92· neo . . . nec: pair the pre-
cepts. ‘ Do not overdo either the super-
natural or the human element.'

192. Horace is of course speaking of
the number of speaking characters who
should be on the stage at once, not of the
number of actors employed or characters
introduced in a play. The introduction
of a second actor is ascribed by Aris-
totle, Poet. 4. 3, to Aeschylus (dialogue
until then having been between the actor
and the leader of the chorus), that of
the third to Sophocles. This improve-
ment was adopted by Aeschylus in
his later plays, but no further addition
was made. See Haigh's Attic Theatre,

. 200.
p laboret: the verb implies misplaced
effort.

193. officium virile: ‘ duty, as
well as a man can do it,' is an emphatic
repetition of ‘actoris partes ' and is in
contrast to the more languid use of the
chorus condemned by Aristotle in the
practice of Euripides: Poet. 187 καὶ

³* Donatus' remark cn the Adelph. 3. 1. 1 ‘tragedia in tria dividitur, expectationem, gesta,
exitum' seems to be parallel to the divisions which he recognises sor a eomedy(argun1em prefixed
to the Andria), into protasis, epitasis, and catastrophe, and to refer to the development of the plot,
not a division os acts, being substantially analogous to Aristotle's requirement that a plot (Poet.

7. 3) should have beginning, middle, and end.
