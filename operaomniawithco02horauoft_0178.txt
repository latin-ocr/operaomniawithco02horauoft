HORATII SATIRARUM

Tostis marcentem squillis recreabis et Afra
Potorem cochlea ; nam lactuca innatat acri
Post vinum stomacho; perna magis ac magis hillis 60

Flagitat immorsus refici;

quin omnia malit

Quaecunque immundis servent allata popinis.

Est operae pretium duplicis pernoscere iuris

Naturam. Simplex e dulci constat olivo,

Quod pingui miscere mero muriaque decebit, 65
Non alia quam qua Byzantia putuit orca.

58-62. ‘ Is the fault is not in the wine
but in the drinker, you must keep him
up to the mark with salt and piqnant
dishes.’ He seems to be speaking of the
later courses. A salad of ‘lactuea‚'
⁵ lettuce‚' was the traditional end of a
Roman supper. Cp. Mart. 13. 14 ‘ Clau-
dere quae cenas lactuca solebat avorum,
Dic mihi, cur nostras inchoat illa dapes’?
The lecturer takes sides against the old
sashion.

58. marcentem, ‘ fiagging.’

squillis, ‘ prawns.’ Sat. 2. 8. 42.

59. innatat, i.e. remains undigested;
Pliny N. H. 23. 22. 1 ‘ dulce (vinum)
stomacho innatat, austerum facilius con-
coquitur.'

61. immorsus, participle = ⁴ vellica-
tus‚' ‘ excitatus.' Cp. ⁴ qualia lassum
Pervellunt stomachum ' Sat. 2. S. 9. ‘It
entreats to be freshened by the sharp
sting rather of dried ham, rather of sau—
sages.' Lambinus followed a few MSS.
in separating the words ‘in morsus,'
comparing Virgil’s ζ reficitque in proelia. '
Aen. 11. 731; but the only sense that
can be put on them is ‘to be sreshened
to a new appetite? But ‘ in morsus' is
a strange phrase—Bentley asks ⁴ an sto—
machus dentes habet? ’—and the end in
question is not to renew the appetite sor
eating but sor drinking. Diiderlein and
Diur. of recent editors accept it. Bentl.
would read ‘ im1n01·sis.'

61, 62. ‘ To a cold salad the stomach

that is served hot and hot in the cook-
shops?

63269. The use of oil and other in-
gredients in the sance or pickle served
with fish. See above v. 50.

63. est operae pretium. Perhaps
there is a mock heroic reminiscence of
Ennius. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 229.

duplicis, either in direct opposition
to ‘simplex,' but in that case there is
some little awkwardness in the sense, as
there are more ingredients than two
named in the fuller sauce, or (as Bentley,
Orelli and others)=0f two kinds—the
‘simpleX‚' which follows, being one of
the two—the ‘compound' being de-
scribed, but not characterized in a single
adjective.

65. This line begins the description
of the compound sance. Bentley’s dif-
ficulty, that in this way the oil is used
twice⁷ as the basis and as the last in-
gredient added in vv. 68, 69. does not
seem serious: 65 and 66 describe the
materials—oil, wine, and brine: 67·69
describe the process and order3 ‘hoc’
is the mixture of the ‘merum’ and
‘muria,' which are to be well mingled
(ί confusum 'hboiled with chopped herbs,
sprinkled with saffron, stood to cool,
and then to have the hest oil added.
Cp. the account of the ‘ius mixtum' in
Sat. 2. 8. 45—53.

pingui, ‘rich and sugary.’

66. ‘ Of the kind ofwhich a Byzantine

would prefer even the coarse dishes of jar has reeked.'

the cookshops‚ provided they were hot
and savoury.’

popinis: illustrated by Mart. 1. 42. 9,
quoted by Bentley, ‘ Quod fumantia qui
tomacla raucus Circumfert tepidis co-
quus popinis.' ‘Popinis' is probably
there the portable ovens of street-hawkers,
and it may be so here. Otherwise the
abl. had better be taken as local, ‘all

putuit, ‘ puteseo ' (see Sat. 2. 3. 194).
Byzantium was the centre ot the thunny
fishery. The ‘ muria’ spoken of seems
to have been a preparation of the roe
and other parts of the thunny‚ salted
and kept. So ‘garum’ (Sat. 2. 8. 46)
from the ‘ scomber.’ They are analogous
to our caviare.
