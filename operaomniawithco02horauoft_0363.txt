LIB. II.

Quod mecum ignorat solus volt scire videri,

Ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,

Nostra sed impugnat, nos nostraque lividus odit.

Quod si tarn Graecis novitas invisa fuisset 90
Quam nobis, quid nunc esset vetus? aut quid haberet
Quod legeret tereretque viritim publicus usus?

Ut primum positis nugari Graecia bellis

Coepit et in vitium fortuna labier aequa,

Nunc athletarum studiis, nunc arsit equorum, 95
Marmoris aut eboris fabros aut aeris amavit,

Suspendit picta voltum mentemque tabella,

Nunc tibicinibus, nunc est gavisa tragoedi53

89. lividus: Sat. 1. 4. 93 n.

92. tereret, ‘thumb,' ‘pore over';
‘ teritur noster ubique liber ’ Mart. 8. 3.
8, ⁴ παιδείαν Κύρου contriveram legendo ’
Cic. ad Fam. 9. 25. 1.

viritim . . . publicus usus. Orelli
is right in seeing in ‘publicus usus’
a shadow of legal meaning. The art
and literature os the Greeks are a public
demesne, not their own private property,
but that of all the world, of Romans
also. ‘Viritim’ adds that each could
find in thern what suited his taste. It
gives the key to the description which
tollows of their variety. By a common
poetical use the actions of an ‘ occupier'
are attributed to the abstract ‘occupa-
tion.'

93. positis bellis. For the expres-
sion cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 291 ‘ Aspera tum
positis mitescent secula bellis.⁷ What
Horace says finds a noticeable illustra-
tion in Arist. Pol. 5. 6 &Velldon's
translation) ε ‘ As the increase of wealth
afforded them better opportunities of
leisure and quickened the moral aspira-
tions of their souls‚ the result was, even
before the Persian wars, and still more
after them, in the full flush of their
achievements, that they essayed every
kind of education, drawing no line any-
where‚ but making experiments in all
directions. Thus the use of the flnte
among other things was introduced into
the educational curriculum) Horace has
probably in his mind particularly the
age of Pericles at Athens as having fol-
lowed that of the Persian war. This
perhaps corresponded roughly in his
view with the burst of literary life

which followed the Punic wars at Rome
(v. 162 soll.). But his purpose must be
remembered : he is not fixing historically
the beginning of Greek art and litera-
ture, for which purpose his words would
be inadequate and misleading. It is the
character, not the moment, that is in
point. ‘ As soon as Greece had leisure
for such things her energy found vent in
a hundred directions at once.'

nugari . . . in vitium labier. The
contrast at the moment is with the more
manly Roman standard from which
‘ graecari ’ gSat. 2. 2. 11) was a declen-
sion : see on Epp. Ι. 18. 49. But, as we
shall see, both in the contrasted descrip-
tion of the Roman modes of using leisure
(vv. 103*1071‚ and when he apologizes
(vv. 118 foll.) for their having taken to
the pursuit of literature, his tone is half
ironical. Literature is his own pursuit,
and he is speaking to Augustus, who
represents the imperial Roman spirit
(Virg. Aen. 6. 847—853). Yet he is not
really ashamed os the Muse, and he is
conscious that the Emperor has some
sympathy with him (Od. 3. 4. 37—40).

labier: for the form of int. see on
Sat. 2. 3. 24.

95. He is thinking of the great
national games and Pindar's celebration
of them: see Od. 4. 2. 17 foll.

97. Cp. with the expression Sat. 2. 7.
95 n. and Virgil's ‘ stupet obtutuque
haeret defixus in uno' Aen. 1. 495, of
Aeneas gazing on the pictures in the
temple.

9-3. tibicinibus. Cp. the passage
quoted on v. 93 from Arist. Pol. 5. 6.
