LIB. Ι.

SAT. 6. 79

Non, ut magna dolo factum negat esse suo pars, 90
Quod non ingenuos habeat clarosque parentes,
Sic me defendam. Longe mea discrepat istis

Et vox et ratio:

nam si natura iuberet

A certis annis aevum remeare peractum

Atque alios legere ad fastum quoscunque parentes 95
Optaret sibi quisque, meis contentus honestos

Fascibus et sellis nollem mihi sumere, demens

Iudicio vulgi, sanus fortasse tuo, quod

Nollem onus haud unquam solitus portare molestum.

Nam mihi continuo maior quaerenda foret res,

100

Atque salutandi plures, ducendus et unus
Et comes alter uti ne solus rusve peregreve
Exirem; plures calones atque caballi

Pascendi‚ ducenda petorrita.

90. dolo suo, said (by Heind.) to
be a juristic use. = ‘culpa sua’; but
perhaps with some play ‘that it is not
of maliee prepense.'

93. ratio, ‘ sententia ‘ Porph., opposed
to ‘ VOX,' as it often is to ‘ oratio,' ‘what
Ι think as well as what Ι say.'

94. a certis annis, ‘ after a fixed
period.' ‘ 1f life repeated itself in cycles.'
Cruquius' note is ‘ post mille annos ait
Plato in Phaedro?

95. I.e. ‘alios legere ad fastum [pa-
rentesl, quoscunque parentes optaret
sibi quisque.’ It has been also punc-
tuated so that ‘ optaret sibi quisque ’
should begin the apodosis‚ ‘ each would
(or ‘ might ') choose for himself? ‘quos-
cunque ' going with ‘alios legere,'‘others‚
whoelver they might be,’ but this is less
simp e.

ad fastum, ‘ to the full of their pride‚'
as ‘ ad voluntatem‚' ⁴ ad arbitrium‚’
etc.

96. honestos fascibus. For the
ablative cp. above v. 36 ‘ignota matre
inhonestus.' There is a varia lectio
with some little MS. authority, ‘ honus-
tos’=‘ onustos‚⁷ strongly supported by
Lambinus. But it would not be so
suitable. Ennobled ancestry would be
a burden (v. 99) to Horace; he is not
concerned to say that the distinction
would have been a burden to them.

97. sellis, sc. ‘ curulibus 'z cp. Epp.
1. 6. 53 ‘ cui libet hic fasces dabit, eripi·
etque curule . . . ebur.'

Nune mihi curto

101. salutandi. The early morning
levees in great people's homes were a
standing vexation in Roman life, Virg.
G. 2462, Juv. S. 3. 126 foll„ 5. 19 foll.‚
76 foll. ‘Salutate' was used both of
those who paid and those who received
the call. See Cic. ad Fam 9. 20 ⁴ mane
salutamus domi . . . multos . . . qui rne
perofficiose observant.’ As Horace is
here giving a whimsical list of the in-
conveniences which would beset him if
he were a great man, he is probably using
it in this latter sense.

102. rusve peregreve. So with
most editors I have given; but the
reading is not quite certain. The mass
of MSS. have ‘rusve peregre aut‚’ and
Porph. interpreted it ‘ ordo est rusve aut
peregre.’ The sound is harsh. but the
conjunction ‘ve' . . . ‘aut’ is possible:
see Prop. 2. 1. 23. It is suggested that
the hypermetric line (sor which cp. Sat.
1. 4. 96) caused the substitution in early
copies of ⁶ aut ’ for ‘ ve.’

103. calones, Epp. 1. 14. 423 used
by Horace apparently for the lower ser·
vants in his town establishment.

104. ducenda, a train of them.
Contrast Umbricius* household (Juv. S.
3. Ιο) which ‘ reda componitur una.'

petorrita, ‘ four - wheel chariots ⁷ :
Epp.2.1. 192.

curto, ‘cauda curta’ Comm. Cruq.
No illustration has been found :unless
‘ curtus equus,’ in Prop. 4. 1. 20, means
a horse whose tail has been cut off5 see
