HORATII ARS POETICA.

Multa dies et multa litura coercuit atque
Praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem.

Ingenium misera quia fortunatius arte

Credit et excludit sanos Helicone poetas
Democritus, bona pars non ungues ponere curat,
Non barbam, secreta petit loca, balnea vitat.
Nanciscetur enim pretium nomenque poetae,

Si tribus Anticyris caput insanabile nunquam
O ego laevus,

Tonsori Licino commiserit.

blue blood of Rome to come to the
rescue of her credit in the matter of
literary industry.

293. litura: Epp. 2. 1. 167, and cp.
Sat. 1. 10. 72 ‘stilum vertas‚‘ and inf.
v. 389 ‘delere.'

294. ad unguem, as in Sat. 1. 5. 32 :
the image from a sculptor or joiner
passing his nail over his work to test
the perfect smoothness·; Virg. G. 277,
Pers. Sat. 1. 64. The question between
praesectum, the nail cut close tie. to
the point where being close to the quick
it will be most sensitive), and ‘per-
fectum’ (to be taken proieptically with
‘castigavit,' ‘till it is persect'>‚ is dif-
ficult to decide. The first is the read—
ing of V and B, and is the less obvious
word. It is strongly supported by
Bentley, and is given by Ritter and
Munro. The latter was read by Acr.
and the Comm. Cruq„ and is preferred
by Orelli, Diffi.. SchiitZ, and Keller.
The error was due to abbreviation, and
the confusion of f and s: cp. Od. 3. ²9·
6, Sat. 1. 1. 2.

295—301. The connection is: ‘This
want of care arises from that foolish
idea that genius is independent of and
⁴ superior to art, which shows itself in
other ways in a disregard of the judg-
ment of the world and the decencies of
lifes

295. ingenium, ‘native gift.‘ For
the contrast of ‘ingenium' and ‘ars’
see below, v. 408 f.

297. Democritus (of Abdera, see on
Epp. 1. 12. 12, 2.1. 94). He wrote a
book περὶ ποιήσεως according to Diog.
Laert. 9. 48. Cicero resers to his opi-
nion more than once⁷ as de Div. 1. 37.
80 ‘negat sine surore Democritus quem-
quam poetam magnum esse posse, quod
idem dicit Plato :⁷ cp. de Or. 2. 46.
194; Plato, as in Ion 5. p. 533, Phaedr.
22. p. 245. Aristotle admits an alter-

VOL. ΙΙ.

native, εὐφυοῦς ἡ ποιητικὴ ἔστιν ἦ μανι-
κοῦ· τούτων ’γὰρ οἱ μὲν εὕπλαστοι οἷ δὲ
ἐκστατικοί Poet. 17. 2.

bona pars: see on Sat. 1. 1. 61.
For the foolish attempts to simulate
inspiration by adopting peculiarities cp.
Epp. 1. 19.10f.

ungues ponere: Epp. 1. 7. 50.

298. barbam. The philosopher also
let his beard grow3 Sat. 1. 3. 133, 2. 3.
35. Horace treats it here as an affecta-
tion of eccentricity.

balnea: as places where he would
meet all the world.

300. tribus Anticyris: cp. Sat. 2.
3. 82 and 1663 ‘three Anticyras' is a
metaphorical, not a litera] phrase. It is
therefore not to be used (as in Dict.
Geog. 5. v. Anticyral as an argument in
favour of there being a third Anticyra
in Locris in addition to those in Phocis
and on the Sinus Maliacus. The one
in Phocis is the one which Strabo (418)
describes as the home of hellebore and
the place of cure for those who needed
it. Stephanus, a late authority x between
the 4th and 7th centuries , attributes the
same character to the one on the Sinus
Maliacus.

301. tonsori Licino. The Scho-
liasts identify this man with the Gaulish
prisoner, and then freedman of Julius
or Augustus, who is with later Latin
writers the type of the rich parvenu,
and on whom the epigram was written
‘ Marmoreo Licinus tumulo iacet, at Cato
parvo, Pompeius nullo. Quis putet esse
deos 2’ See Pers. S. 2. 36, Juv. S 1. 109
(see Mayor's note), 14. 505. It is how-
ever generally held to be a mistake;
see Madv. Opusc. Acad. 2. p. 202 f.
Horace’s Licinus was a barber of the
time.

O ego laevus, ‘clumsy fellow that 1
am!’ Cp. the ironical reasons given
sor not writing poetry in Epp. 2. 2.
