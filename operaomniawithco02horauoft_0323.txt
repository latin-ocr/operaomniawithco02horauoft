EPIST. 18.

307

Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,

Quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atris,

Dum volt libertas dici mera veraque virtus.

Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrimque reductum.

Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi ιο
Derisor lecti sic nutum divitis horret,

Sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit,

Ut puerum saevo credas dictata magistro

Reddere vel partes mimum tractare secundas.

Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina, 15

6. inconcinna, ‘ awkward '; Epp. 1.
17. 29, but cp. also the opposite ‘con-
cinnus ' Sat. 1. 3. 50.

gravis, ‘ forbidding,' ‘ disagreeable.'
So Cic. de Rep. 1. 43 ‘ senes ad ludum
adolescentium descendant ne sint iis
odiosi ac graves.'

7. tonsa cute: perh. ‘ with skin
like a stubble-field.' ‘ Tondere crinem '
meant to clip or trim the hair, and was
opposed to ‘radere,' to shave the slzin
clean. ‘Tondere cutem’ (an equally
permissible phrase, for they said ‘ tondere
prata’ (Virg. G. 1. 290), as well as
⁶ segetes,' ‘ gramina ') must imply close
clipping. elipping as a field is shorn so
as to leave mere stubble. Such close
cropping of the hair belonged apparently
to those who lived or affected to live
roughly. slaves of the less rcfined class
(‘ de grege sordidaque villa Tonsos,
horridulos‚ rudes ’ Mart. 10. 98. 8³, Stoic
philosophers (though they wore the
beard long) ⁶ detonsa iuventus ⁷ Pers. 3.
54. Cp. note on Epp. 1. 7. 50 ‘ad-
rasum.'

dentibus atris: another affected sign
of neglect of appearances. Theophras-
tus gives among the characteristics of
'the μικροφιλότιμος that ⁴ he has his hair
cut frequently and keeps his teeth
white.’

8. dum volt, ‘ desiring all the while.'
This form is speeially used by Horace
in assigning motives for actions that are
described. Epp. 1. 2. 21 ‘dum parat‚'
1. 7. 79 ‘dum quaerit,' A. P. 250 ‘ dum
vitat,' 465 ⁶ dum eupit.‘

9. The antithetical position ‘ virtus. . .
virtus.’ etc„ gives the connection. ‘ It
poses as virtue—whereas virtue lies no
more in one extreme than in the other)

medium vitiorum. The doctrine of
Aristotle that virtue lies in a mean

μεσότης δύο κακιῶν τῆς μὲν καθ’ ὑπερ-

βολήν, τῆς δὲ κατ’ ἔλλειψιν Eth. N. 2. 6.
See on Sat. 1. 2. 24.

utrimque reductum : kept caresully
back from both extremes. ‘ Utrimque
remotum⁷ is a phrase in Lucr. 5. 839,
though in a different connection.

10. alter, sc. the ‘scurra.’

imi derisor lecti: ajester to be found
011 the ‘ lowest' couch, i. e. acc. to Sat. 2.
S. 40 the coueh on which the entertainer
himself reclined with his own hench-
men; ‘derisor' is illustrated by Sat. 1.
4. 87, 88.

12. verba cadentia tollit, ‘picks
up every word he lets drop’; ‘temere
prolata suscipit pro mirandis ' Aer.
There is perhaps (as Schiitz suggests)
the metaphor felt of crumbs falling from
the table and picked up by the dogs.

13. saevo: a master like Orbilius,
Epp. 2. 1. 70, of whom he is afraid.

dictata reddere: an habitual phrase
of repeating a lesson; ‘ista quasi dictata
redduntur’ Cic. de N. D. 1. 26. 72; see
on Epp. 1. 1. 55.

14. partes mimum tractare se-
cundas, ‘a mime-actor,' because his
imitation is so exaggerated and the-
atrical; ‘playing the second part‚' be-
cause it was the duty of the δευτερα-
Ὑωνὶστης or actor ‘ secundarum partium’
to play in every way to the lead of the
first actor. This is a frequent source of
metaphor and similitude, as in Cic Div. in
Q. Caee. 15. 48 ‘ ut in actoribus Graecis
fieri videmus saepe illum qui est se-
cundarum aut tertiarum partium, cum
possit aliquanto clarius dicere quam
ipe primarum, multum summittere ut
ille princeps quarn maxime excellat, sic
faciet Alienus: tibi serviet, tibi lenoci-
nabitur.'

15. alter, the client who affeets in-
dependeuce.
