Adiecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae,

Scilicet ut vellem curvo dinoscere rectum,

Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum. 45
Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,

Civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma

Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.

Unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

Decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni 50
Et laris et fundi, paupertas impulit audax,

Ut versus facerem: sed quod non desit habentem

Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,

place of Homer in Roman education
see Quintil. 1. 8. 5 ‘optime institutum
est ut ab Homero [et Vergilio] lectio
inciperet,’ Plin. Epp. 2. 14. 2 ‘in foro
pueros a centumviralibus causis auspi-
cari ut ab Homero in scholis.'

43. bonae with Athenae; a touch
of affectionate retrospect, ‘my “alma
mater.'’'

paulo plus artis. ‘a little further
skill) He implies that philosophy was
an advance upon mere literary study.

44. vellem. The MSS. vary between
‘ vellem‚' ί possim,' and ‘ possem.⁷ Keller
finds the most authority for the first,
the least for the last. ‘Possim' would
hardly stand. Munro and Ritter give
‘possem.' There is force in the argu-
ment that ‘ vellem ' is at first sight the
harder reading, and the least likely to
have been due to an emender. It is
Horace's purposed substitution for ‘ pos-
sem.’ It is a 1655011 that he has not
learnt perfectly yet, only to wish to
learn it.

curvo . . . rectum. Cp. Pers. S. 3.
52 ‘curvos deprendere mores,y 4. 11
‘ rectum discernis ubi inter Curva subit,'
5. 38 ‘intortos extendit regula mores.'
Itis an extension ofthe original meta-
phor which spoke of right conduct as
a straight course (⁴ rectum ⁹) ; the prose
word is ‘ pravus.' For ‘ dinoscere ⁷ with
abl. see Epp. 1. 15. 29 n.

45. inter silvas Academi: the gar-
den, named from the hero Academus,
where Plato and his successors taught.
Brutus, and doubtless Horace, actually
attended the lectures of Theomnestus
the academie. He is speaking however
generally os his philosophical studies.

47. It is best to join civilis aestus
and rudem belli, with the latter cp.

¹ rudis agminum ⁷ Od. 3. 2. 9. With the
metaphor of tulit aestus cp. Od. 2. 7.
15, 16 ‘ Te rursus in bellum resorbens
Unda fretis tulit aestuosis.'

48. responsura, ‘ to be a match for.'
Notiee that he says nothing of the merits
of the cause (see on Od. 2. 7. 11). His
compliment to the emperor is that it
was an idle enterprise; the arms were
as playthings to the ‘ thews ' of Caesar.
The double title (only here in Horace,
cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 73, 8. 678) emphasizes
this ; it is a way of saying ⁴ Caesar, the
master os the world.’

lacertis, the metaph. from wrestling.
as Cic. ad Fam. 4. 7. 2 ‘pugnabamus
. . . lacertis et viribus quibus pares non
eramus.’

49. simul primum, a rare combi-
nation. Cicero has ‘ simulac primum '
Verr. 2. 1. 13. 3.

dimisere, ‘gave me my discharges
unde = ‘ab armis.’ Horace gave up
the cause, though some of his friends
followed the fortunes of Sextus Pom-
peius; see Od. 2. 7.

50. decisis pennis. For the metaph.
cp. Epp. 1. 20. 21, and more closely
Cic. ad Att. 4. 2. 5 ‘iidem illi qui mihi
pinnas inciderant volunt easdem renasci?
The note of Porph. is ⁴' significat se pro<
scriptum esse.' His estate at Venusia
was no doubt forfeited.

52. quod non desit habentem. It
would seem from Juvenal S. 7. 62 ‘ satur
est cum dicit Horatius Evoe!' that he
did not take Horace’s account of his
motives in writing poetry too literally.

53. cicutae, the plur. of quantity.
It was used as a eooling drug. and
so might be supposed to cure madness.
which the ancients traced to fulness ofbile
and heat of blood. Cp. Pers. S. 5. 144
