HORATII· SATIRARUM

Hic mutat merces surgente a sole ad eum quo

Vespertina tepet regio, quin per mala praeceps 30
Fertur uti pulvis collectus turbine, ne quid

Summa deperdat metuens aut ampliet ut rem:

Omnes hi metuunt versus, odere poetas.

‘ Faenum habet in cornu3 longe fuge: dummodo risum

Et pueros et anus?

Agedum, pauca accip& contra.

extravagance‚ v. 109. That the name
belonged to Horace's friend, the poet
Tibullus <Od. 1. 33 and Epp. 1. 4) who
of course is not meant, is perhaps a
proof that it is not taken at haphazard,

33. They hate the poet because they
are afraid of what he writes,

34. Porph. vouches for its having
been a custom in his time to warn
passeis-by against a dangerous bull by
fastening a wisp of hay to its horns. A
metaph. allusion to the same practice is
found in Plutarch, Vita Crassi. For
the satirist as an angryrbull cp. Epod.

cornua?

35. excutiat, ‘succeed in raising; '
‘excutere 1acrimas.’ Ter. Heaut. 1. 1.
