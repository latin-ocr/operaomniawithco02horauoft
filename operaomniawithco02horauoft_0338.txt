EPISTLE XX.

TO HIS OWN BOOK.

Verses 1-5. YOU are longing for the publicity of a booksellers’ stall, and have
sorgotten the modesty to which Ι bred you.

5, 6. Well, go, if you will ἔ Remember there is no coming back.

6—8. You will be sorry when you find what criticism is, and how soon people tire
of you.

9-18. I soretell your fate—In the bloom of novelty you will be liked; then the
vulgar will begin to thumb you; then you will be forgotten or sent to the
provinces. The last humiliation is to be turned into a schoolbook.

19-28. When you get an audience mind you tell them what Ι did, what Ι looked
like, what I was, and when Ι lived.

It is the epilogue to the Book—playful in tone, but recalling, though in an
altered form, the proud and confident anticipations of Od. 3. 30. It is with cha-
racteristic irony that he describes the widespread farne which he foresee5‚ as some-
thing to be dreaded rather than sought. The last ten lines show the pleasure
which he really finds in the thought that all the world will be interested to know
every detail about him. At the same time he is, no doubt, so far serious in his
profession that it is the applause of the few that he most values. Cp. the tone of
Sat. 1. 10. 81 foll.

His book, now finished and ready for publication, is addressed in terms borrowed
in part from the image of a favourite slave anxious to escape from the protec-
tion and restraint of his master's house into a naughty world, where he will be
made much of at first and wronged and forgotten presently. The figure is lightly
handled, not pressed (as by some commentators) into tasteless detail.

On the date given in the concluding lines see introd. to Epistles, Book 1.
p. 208.

The device by which the author professes to address to his own book what he
wishes to say to the world by way of preface or epilogue‚ is frequent in the Roman
poets‚ as Ovid‚ Trist. 1. 1; ex Pont. 4. 5; Martial 1. 4, 2. 1, 3. 2, 4, 5, 8. 1, 10.
104, 11. 1, 12. 3. Such passages often bear traces of remembrance of this
Epistle.
