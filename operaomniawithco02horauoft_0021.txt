TO THE SATIRES. 9

upon himself. He would escape more and more into the back-
ground and let others seem to speak. He is an interested, amused,
hearer and learner, not a Stoic, nor even an Epicurean, dogmatist.

No one interfered with his patent to the title. Persius, who, even
when in his Stoic fervour he departs furthest from Horace's spirit,
copies his form most closely, gives no name to his own composition.
Juvenal, to whom there are no uncertainties, no lights and shadcs
in his confident and ruthless declamation, returned to the name of
Satires¹.

If the Satires are imitations of conversation, they have naturally
a personal element. Conversation starts from persons and incidents‚
it prefers concrete instances to abstract descriptions, a flavour of inno-
cent malice is not out of place in it, its greatest adornment is the art
of telling stories vividly and at the happy moment. As a whole it
must be allowed that Horace's writing has this effect in a singular
degree aster the lapse of nineteen centuries. Even if Nomentanus
and Opimius had no life outside his verses, he gives them life enough
for his purpose. The interest of going behind what he has told us
and seeing how far his characters can be identified with particular
persons historically known, lies not so much in any gain of point to
the Satire that may be looked for,—the persons are too obscure, as well
as the results too uncertain, for that,—but in the light which it may
throw on the methods of the poet, on his persona] motives, and on
his relations to his contemporaries.

The Scholiasts are prepared in most cases to tell us who each per-
son named is. They had access to earlier sources of information ²,
and no doubt in some cases they have preserved for us a true tradi-
tion. But they evidently blunder. They differ from one another,
showing that the tradition itself was unsettled. They betray that they
are merely paraphrasing the context, sometimes the context mis-
understood. They are not trustworthy on the question on which they
had the greatest advantage over us, viz. the question whether a name
is borrowed or not from some earlier writer. An instance which
