LIB. II.

SAT. 7. 191

Scurra Volanerius, postquam illi iusta cheragra 15
Contudit articulos, qui pro se tolleret atque

Mitteret in phimum talos, mercede diurna

‘Conductum pavit3 quanto constantior isdem

In vitiis, tanto levius miser ac prior illo,

Qui iam contento, iam laxo fune laborat.' 20
Non dices hodie, quorsum haec tam putida tendant,

Furcifer? ‘Ad te, inquam.'

Quo pacto, pessime? ‘Laudas

Fortunam et mores antiquae plebis, et idem

Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat usque recuses,

Aut quia non sentis quod clamas rectius esse, 25
Aut quia non firmus rectum defendis, et haeres
Nequicquam caeno cupiens evellere plantam.

Vertumnus in all his thousand shapes.’
Ovid calls Vertumnus ‘conveniens di-
versis iste figuris . . . deus ' Fast. 6. 341,
and describes at length, in Met. 14. 642
soll„ his metamorphoses when he was
wooing Pomona. He was in origin the
god of the changing year, generalized
as the god of change. He has made
Priscus as changeable as himself.

15. iusta, ‘well earned.'

17. phimum. The Greek name for
a dice-box3 whether of precisely the
same kind as the ‘fritillus' is a moot
question. The Scholiasts differ. See
Mayor’s note on Juv. S. 14. 5.

18. isdem. A large number of good
MSS. have ‘idem.’

19. levius miser ι perhaps with some
feeling of the use (common in Plautus)
of‘miser’ for ‘ sick.' Cp. Cicero's ‘leviter
aegrotare!

19, 20. Few lines of Horace have
been more vexed by copyists. The va—
riants are, in v. 19. (a) *ac prior ille’3
(b) ‘ac prior illo ’ ; (c) ‘acrior ille’; (d)
‘acriorillo.' Inv. 20 ta) ‘iam .. . quam'3
(b) ‘tam . . quam '3 (c) ‘ iam . . iam.’

Of these in v. 19, the reading of
strongest external authority is ‘acrior
i11e‚’which was in three of the Blandinian
MSS. and was interpreted by Aer. ‘ Ac
prior,' however, which was in the fourth
Bland„ and is found in good extant
MSS„ is not like an emendation. It is
easier to imagine the obliteration of ‘ p ’
in some archetype. The hesitation be-
tween ‘ i11e⁷ and ‘illo,' and the varia-
tions of v. 20 seem due to different, and

some awkward. attempts to make sense
of the lines. ‘ Iam . . iam’ was inter-
preted by Aer. ‘iam “ modo '’ intelle·
gendum = modo laxo, modo con-
tento.' As given in the text, the lines
present no difficulty. ‘Prior' has the
sense os ‘ better‚' ‘in a better position,'
as in Epp. Ι. 1. 88. If ‘ille' is read
‘ac' must be taken as following the
comparatives ‘levius' and ‘prior’ in
the sense of ‘the first mentioned,' i.e.
Priscus,—an awkwardly prosaic ex-
pressmn.

20. contento . . . laxo fune. The
metaphor is perhaps from a ship. The
danger may be either from straining the
rope too tight or from letting it swing too
loose. Cp. 1110 metaphor from a similar
subject in Od. 3. 10. 10.

21. hodie. ‘ must 1 wait all day with-
out your telling me what all this stale
stuff eomes to '?

22. furcifer. One who has worn or
deserves to wear the ‘furca‚’ an instru-
ment of servile punishment—a yoke in
the shape of a V, which was put over
the neck and the arms being fastened
along it.

23. The reference seems to be to Sat.
2. 2. 89—93.

24. si quis deus: Sat. 1. 1.15.

25-27. Either because it is all talk,
not your genuine feeling, or because
with right purposes you have not the
energy 10 carry them out.

27. Cp. the Greek proverbial expres-
sion, as in Aeseh. Cho. 669 ἔξω κομίζων
. . . πηλοῦ πόδα.
