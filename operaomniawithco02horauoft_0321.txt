EPISTLE XVIII.

TO LOLLIUS.

Verses 1-9. YOU are sure, Lollius, to avoid one extreme, that of the mere parasite.
You will have to beware of the other, that of the man who shows his indepen<
dence by rudeness.

10-14. The one flatters and echoes his patron.

15—20. The other quarrels about trifles, blusters about the most insignificant ques-
tions of gossip.

21—36. A patron hates and avoids a dependent who has extravagant tastes, who is
greedy of money, who is not content with his station. If he does not hate
him he reads him a Iesson. ‘ Vice is a luxury permissible only to the rich.
Dress modestly and don‘t imitate me.' It is good advice. Smart clothes
have ruined many a man, as Eutrapelus knew.

37, 38. You will remember th t your patron‘s secrets are his own property.
You will not pry into them3 if he entrust you with one you will keep it
saeredly.

39, 40. So in the matter of tastes. You will not flout his tastes in words, nor
in practice show that you want to write verses when he wants to go
hunting.

41-44. This is how Zethus and Amphion fell out, till Amphion put away his
lyre.

44—57. Get up and go out with him. It is fine exercise, an«J you are an adept in
manly exercises. You have begun early with some hard campaigning.

58-66. You are even fond of military sports at your own country house. If γοα
meet his tastes he will meet yours.

67—71. For more particular advice; be cautious in talking of his affairs.

72·75. Don’t set your heart on one of his slaves.

76-85. Be very careful whom you introduce, and if you make a mistake and
introduce an unworthy man, be prompt to acknowledge it, that you may have
the power to protect the worthy‚ when he is attacked, as you may be yourself,
by the tongue of slander.

85-88. You see there are risks in cultivating a great friend. You must take care
lest all your labour be wasted.

89—95. You must accommodate your moods to his ; remember that shyness is sure
to be misconstrued.
