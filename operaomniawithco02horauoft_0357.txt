Te nostris ducibus, te Grais anteferendo.

Cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque 20
Aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota suisque

Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit;

Sic fautor veterum, ut tabulas peccare vetantes

Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

Vel Gabiis vel cum rigidis aequata SabiniS, 25
Pontificum libros, annosa volumina vatum,

Dictitet Albano Musas in monte locutas.

Si quia Graiorum sunt antiquissima quaeque

Scripta vel optima, Romani pensantur eadem

viz. in preferring. etc.? or masc., agree-
ing with te? Probably the latter. In
the former case a comma should be put
at ‘uno,’ with Orelli, Di111·.‚ and Keller.
The argument for that view is the more
complete antithesis which seems to be
gained between ⁶ uno ³ and ‘ cetera.' On
the other hand it may be said that the
greater antithesis, viz. between ‘ sapiens
et iustus,’ and {the character described
by ‘cetera nequaquam,⁷ etc, is empha-
sized by every touch which brings out
the largeness of what they grant. This
‘ uno te,' etc. does : ‘ though they show
wisdom and justice in setting you, you
only, before all our own captains, all
the captains of Greece.'

20. ratione modoque: cp. Sat. 2.
3. 266 and 271. As that passage shows,
not a mere pleonasm, as ‘more modo-
que' in Od. 4. 2. 28, but with some
sense that the ‘ principle and method’
are reasonable.

21. suis temporibus defuncta:
‘ quae sua tempora compleverint ac
finierint ⁷ Porph.

23. sic fautor. Horace uses ‘sic'
for ‘tam’ or ‘adeo' with adjecffives,
Sat. 1. 3. 19, 1. 5. 69; Epp. 2.1.179.
So with verbs or participles, Sat. 2. 8.

tabulas: the XII Tables of the de-
cemviri.

2 5. Gabiis vel oum rigidis aequata
Sabinis. For the omission of ‘eum'
with the first subst„ see on Od. 3. 25. 2.
Dionys. Halicarn. (3. 33 and 4. 58)
vouches for the existence in his time
(the Augustan age) of what professed
to be the original treaties of Tullus

Hostilius with the Sabines, and Tar—
quinius Superbus with the Gabii.

aequata : a coloured substitution sor
‘ facta'; ‘ quibus aequabant condiciones ’
Acr.

26. pontificum libros: Cic. de Or.
1. 43. 193, where the XII Tables are
classed as monuments of antiquity with
these ancient rules of ritual.

vatum, ‘ seers‚’ not merely poets.
The ref. is to such compositions as the
‘carmina Marciana,’ which Livy de-
scribes (25. 12) as having contained a
foreshadowing of the battle of Cannae;
see VVordsworth, Fragm. ofAnc. Latin,
p 257.7dictitet: Epp. 1. 16. 22; ‘never
tire of saying.'

Albano in monte: as on a Roman
Parnassus. It has been suggested that
Horace is parodying some such boast
as that recorded in Quintilian 10. 1. 99
‘ in comoedia maxime claudicamus, licet
Varro Musas, Aeli Stilonis sententia,
Plautino dieat sermone locuturas fuisse,
si Latine loqui vellent.'

28. ‘If we argue that because the
oldest Greek writers are the best there-
fore the oldest Roman writers are so
also, we ignore the vast difference be-
tween the Greeks and ourselves. We
are transferring the characteristics of
nuts to olives, and of olives to nuts.
We may as soon say that our painting
and music and wrestling are better than
those of the Greeks? Horace often
dwells on the great gulf set by nature
between Greek and Roman genius; see
inf. vv. 93-108, A. P. 323. To refuse
to see this and argue as is the same laws
governed both is to fly in the face of
nature.
