ADDITIONAL Nori: ΟΝ VERsE 3.

Maiora minorave fama. Doubt hangs over both the reading and the meaning.
The earliest editors, followed by Bentley without comment, gave ‘ 1ninorane.’
This is not found in any tenth cent. MSS. Holder gives ‘ne’ as the reading of
Regin„ but this has ‘ ue ’ as has been veristed. Ε lias ‘ minoraque.’ Ilolder in the

verse as containing two questions: ‘ What of Symrna and Colophon? Are they
greater 01· less than their reputeP’ It 15 doubtful however (apart from external
evidence for the reading) whether the intrusion of a fresh question does not
injure the sense. The meaning of the four times repeated ‘quid [tibi visa] '2 ’ is

traveller's own frame of mind z ‘ Has he had the good sense to feel that home was
the best place after all? or has he, for one or another of a traveller's reasons, been
fascinated by any of them? ' If we read ‘ ve‚⁷ some uncertainty is left as to the punc-
tuation and sense. (r) It would be possible (if the consideration just alleged does

not bar it) still to put the two notes of interrogation and translate, not ‘are they
