EPIST. 1.

Ne cures 63, quae stulte miraris et optas,

Discere et audire, et meliori credere non vis?

Quis circum pagos et circum compita pugnax

Magna coronari contemnat Olympia, cui spe5‚ 50
Cui sit condicio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?

‘O cives, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est3

Virtus post nummos :' haec Ianus summus ab imo
Prodocet, haec recinunt iuvenes dictata senesque, 55
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto.

47. ne eures : the negative purpose to emphasize ‘ senes’ ironieally.

of ‘ discere‚⁷ etc., ‘to save yourself from
caring for,' etc.

48. meliori: cp. Epp. 1. 2. 68 ‘te
melioribus offer!

49—51. These lines enforce by an illus-
tration the appeal of vv. 47, 48. Com-
pare the prize in the two cases and the
effort required. It is as though a hack
prize—fighter were offered a garland at
Olympia without having to fight for it.

50. coronari Olympia, a Graecism ε
στεφανοῦσθαι Ὀλύμπια, 35 Ε11111115 ‘ vicit
Olumpia,' quoted by Cic. de Sen. 5. 13.

52. vilius, ete. This is the inter-
pretation of the preceding question.
‘ Virtue is the prize offered, and that is
as much more valuable than gold, which
you are secking at such eost, as gold
itself is more valuable than silver. But
(he goes on) here is the difficulty :—this
doctrine which seems to me so clear is
the very opposite of the doctrine which
all the world preaches and repeats.⁷

10 answer to ‘recinunt dictata'; ‘ deals
forth as from the teacher's chair.' ‘ Prae-
doeet‚' ‘perdocet,’ each found in a few
MSS. of inferior value, are emendations
of a rare word.

recinunt dictata: Epp. 1. 18. 13
‘saevo dictata magistro Reddere ’ (cp.
Sat. 1. 10. 75), of lessons taught orally
and repeated in sing-song by the class.

56. The line is repeated from Sat.
1. 6. 74, where see note. It seems here

w Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque;

‘ Yes,
the old, in this matter, are as true
schoolboys as those whom 1 used to 566
and whom Ι described tripping to school
at Venusia.' Similar repetitions of 311116
with a purpose occur between Sat. Ι. 2.
27 and Sat. 1. 4. 92; Sat. 1. S. 11 and
Sat. 2. Ι. 22 ; apparently without a pur-
pose between Sat. Ι. 2. 13 and A. P.
4213 Sat. 2. 3. 163 and Epp. 1. 6. 28;

57, 58. The great majority of editors
since Cruquius place these lines in this
order, and there is some MS. authority
for it, including Holder’s E and g.
Bentley, who argues strongly for it, sup-
poses 57 to have been at some time
omitted and Wrongly replaced. He
points out that in one of his MSS. (that
belonging to Magdalen College, Oxford)
it is inserted after v. 61.

11* 58 is to be put before 57, we must
imagine it to be a reply of the money-
seeker, answering to that made in Sat.
1. 1. 62 ‘ Nil satis est (inquit) quia tanti
quantum habeas sis.' ‘ Nay, the world
is right, not you, for Ι am still some
way off the income which carries with it
respectability.' But this 15 3 56110115
break in 311 otherwise orderly series of
thought. Putting 57 before 58 we find
Horace still pursuing his statement that
the world puts money before merit.
That is the 1655011 taught on ’Change.
That is the 1655011 (50 vv. 57—59 run) of
our social distinctions.
