SATIRE II.

A FOOL'S WAY OF AVOIDING ONE FOLLY IS TO FALL
χ INTO ANOTHER.

THIS is the text of the earlier part of the Satire, and, though the thread is not
kept perfectly, of the unreadable discussion of vice in which it ends. It is a text
on which Horace is fond of dwelling—we have already had it in Sat. 1. 101 f.

The general view is no doubt right which makes this a specimen of Horace's
earliest attempts at Satire. It is the satire, which by quoting v. 27 in Sat. 1. 4.
92, he makes the typical instance of the personality by which he had roused alarm
and enmity. The Scholiasts tell us that the real Maltinus (or Malchinus) os v. 21
was Maecenas, If this tradition is true, it must follow that the Satire was written
before Horace had made Maecenas' acquaintance, and that it was by Maecenas'
wish that the line was left as it had stood. Such a liberty was certainly never re-
peated.

For the Tigellius of v. 3 see introduction to the next satire.

AMBUBAIARUM collegia, pharmacopolae,

Mendici, mimae. balatrones, hoc genus omne

Maestum ac sollicitum est cantoris morte Tigelli.

Quippe benignus erat. Contra hic, ne prodigus esse
Dicatur metuens, inopi dare nolit amico, 5
Frigus quo duramque famem propellere possit.

Hunc si perconteris, avi cur atque parentis

Praeclaram ingrata stringat malus ingluvie rem,

Omnia conductis coemens obsonia nummis,

Sordidus atque animi quod parvi nolit haberi, 10

1. Ambubaiarum. The word oc-
curs again in a similar connection in
Suet. Ner. 27 ‘ambubaiarum minis-
teria.’ lt is explained by the Scholiasts
as a designation of Syrian women who
played the flute-—from the Syriae name
of the instrument. Cp. Juv. 3. 62 ‘ Iam
pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Or·
ontes Et linguam et mores et cum tibicine
chordas Vexit.'

collegia, ¹ guilds‚’ ‘fraternities,’ a term
used ironically.

pharmacopolae, vendors of drugs.
They would have a bad name both as
quacks and as purveyors of poison—
such a ‘ pharmacopola circumforaneus '
is mentioned as an agent in murder in

Cic. Clu. 14. 40.

2. balatrones, perhaps the same
word as ‘blatero‚‘ and so probably
meaning properly ‘idle or random
talkers.' It occurs as the nickname of
a ‘ scurra’ in Sat. 2. 8. 21, etc. Here
it seems to designate some class of
mime—actors.

4. quippe: gives their reason, and
in their own words. They called him
‘ generous!

hic. As
other.'

8. ingrata, ‘thankless‚' ‘ insatiable.'

stringat, as a bough is stripped os
leaves.

9. conductis, ‘ borrowed,‘ as Juv. S.
11. 46 ‘ eonducta pecunia.'

‘hunc’ in V. 7 ''an-
