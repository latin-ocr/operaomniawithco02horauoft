Illi scripta quibus comoedia prisca viris est

Hoc stabant, hoc sunt imitandi3

quos neque pulcher

Hermogenes unquam legit neque simius iste
Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.
‘At magnum fecit quod verbis Graeca Latinis 20

Miscuit.'

O seri studiorum! quine putetis

Difficile et mirum Rhodio quod Pitholeonti

cantur iudice lites.'
58. 236 ‘odiosas res saepe, quas argu-
mentis dilui non facile est, ioco risuque
dissolvit.’

16. See note on Sat. 1. 4. 2.

viris is evidently eontrasted here with
the effeminate taste of the day. For
the dative cp. Epp. 1. 19. 3 ‘scribuntur
aquae potoribus‚’ Madv. ξ 250 a.

17. stabant. They owed their suc-
cess to this. A phrase of the theatre,
opp. ‘caderes ἐκπίπτειν; Epp. 2. 1. 176
‘cadat an recto stet sabula talo.’

hoe covers the whole description of
the excellence of satirical composition,
vv. 9-16.

pulcher, said osa fop.

18. Hermogenes: sc. Tigellius. See
on Sat. 1. 4. 72 and introd. to Sat. 1. 3.

simius: probably, as the Schol. say,
the Demetrius of v. 90.

19. This verse is best illustrated by
Cicero's ‘O poetam egregium, qnam-
quam ab his cantoribus Euphorionis con-
temnitur' ! Tusc. 3. 19. 45, where ‘can-
toribus‚' as ‘ cantare' here, is of reciting
in a sing-song and maudlin tone. Cp.
‘ plorare' v. 91. Euphorion of Chalcis
was a popular elegiae poet of the Alex-
andrine school whom Cicero is there
contrasting with the more manly stand-
ard os their own Ennius. It is as imi-
tators of the Alexandrine poets instead
of the great Greek classics‚ Homer,
Alcaeus, Archilochus, that Horace is
here vilipending Calvus and Catullus.
He is not just to Catullus, but he is
treating him as a representative of the
school with which he was always at
war. Calvus is C. Licinius Calvus, the
orator and poet, a contemporary and
close friend of Catullus.

20. ‘ Surely it was a seat to mingle
Greek words in his verses as he did.⁷ An
argument imagined for adefender of Lu-
cilius, but hardly a serious one. Cp.
ιαἰγίλιποι montes’ in fr. 3. 7. It was
a practice of early Latin writing—not

Cp. Cic. de Or. 2.

entirely dropped in Lucretius (4. 1162,
ete), criticized by Cicero, de Off. 1. 31.
111 ‘ut sermone eo debemus uti qui
notus est nobis, ne, ut quidam, Graeca
verba inculcantes iure optimo irridea-
mur ’—but allowed by himself freely in
the freedom of his letters.

21. seri studiorum : a translation of
the Greek ὀψιμαθεῖς, of dunces turned
pedants. So Aulus Gellius (11. 7),
probably in reminiscence of the passage,
as he is speaking of the practice of intro-
ducing antiquated novel or foreign
words, ‘est adeo id vitium plerumque
serae eruditionis, quam Graeci ὀψιμαθίαν
appellant, ut quod numquam didiceris,
diu ignoraveris, cum id scire aliquando
coeperis, magni facias quo in loco cun-
que et quacunque in re dicere? Horace
adds point to his criticism by setting the
example of translating the Greek word.

quine. A usage of the eomie dra-
matists. See Ter. Ad. 2. 3. 8 ‘festi-
vum eaput! Qui ne omnia sibi post
putavit esse prae meo commodo [e ’ ‘ Qui '
is the nom. plur. of the relative: the
interrogative tone added by ⁶ ne ' gives
a rhetorical emphasis-‘ what? when
you think,⁷ etc. Cp. the exclamatory ‘ ne ’
in ⁵ utne ' Sat. 2. 5. 18. It is found, as
Bentley says on the passage quoted from
Terence,both with the ind. and subj., that
is, both with ‘ qui’ as a simple relative
and with causal or other force which
affects the mood. For the first see
Virg. Aen.1o. 673 ‘Quos ne, nefas, omnes
infanda morte reliqui.’ In my note on
Epod. 1. 7 this place was inadvertently
quoted as an instance of the redundant
‘ ne ’ with the interrogative ‘ qui.'

22. Pitholeonti. Nothing is known
of him unless we accept Bentley's inge-
nious suggestion, that he is the same as
Pitholaus (he compares the double forms
of the names Τιμόλαος, Τιμολέων-Μενέ-
λαος, Μενέλεως) mentioned by Suetonius
(Jul. 75) as a poetical libeller of Julius

Caesar.
