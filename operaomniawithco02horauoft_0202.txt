HORATII SATIRARUM

Mancipium domino et frugi quod sit satis, hoc est

Ut vitale putes.’

Age, libertate Decembri,

Quando ita maiores voluerunt, utere ; narra. 5
‘ Pars hominum vitiis gaudet constanter et urget

Propositum ;
Interdum pravis obnoxia.

pars multa natat, modo recta capessenS‚
Saepe notatus

Cum tribus anellis, modo laeva Priscus inani,

Vixit inaequalis, clavum ut mutaret in horas, 10
Aedibus ex magnis subito se conderet, unde

Mundior exiret vix libertinus honeste3

Iam moechus Romae, iam mallet doctus Athenis

Vivere, Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis.

3. frugi z ‘ servus frugi ³ Cic. Clu. 16.
47 ; ⁴ honest‚’ ‘serviceable.'

4. ut vitale putes : that you need not
fear his being ‘ too good to live’; accord-
ing to the proverbial saying in Menander,
fr. 4. 105 ὃν οἱ θεοῖ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνήσκει
νεῦς-

ut explains ‘quod sit satis' as qualisy-
ing the preceding adjectives. Cp. Sat. 2.
6. 82. For ‘vitale' cp. Sat. 2. 1. 62.

libertate Decembri. The Saturn-
alia were a remembrance of the golden
age—men were equal again. ‘Saturn-
alibus tota servis licentia permittitur ’
Macrob. Saturn. Ι. 7, ‘ mos traditus illinc
Iste ut cum dominis famuli epulentur
ibidem ⁷ Accius quoted ibid.

6. Notice that there is no attempt to
make Davus speak in character. He
begins nt once with a Stoie apophthegm,
illustrated by stock instances after the
manner of Satire. Priscus and Vola-
nerius are not persons within his own
cognizance.

7. natat, of one who is ‘ at sea‚’ who
has no solid ground under him. Cicero
usesit de Nat. Deorum 3. 24- 62, but the
figure is there helped by the jest of de-
riving the name ‘ Neptunus a natando‚’
‘ magis tu mihi natare visus es quam
ipse Neptunus.’

S. notatus : see on Sat. 1. 3. 24,
1. 6. 143 ‘ noticed' and by way of criti-
cism.

9. eum, ‘ as being with,' ‘ as wearing)
Three rings are spoken of as an extreme
number. In later times Martial's fop
‘Senos . . . omnibus digitis gerit' 11.
59, and Seneca, Nat. Quaest. 7. 31 says
‘ exornamus anulis digitos: in omni ar—

ticulo gemma disponitur.' The original
Roman practice (for those who had the
‘ius anuli ') was to wear one signet
ring of iron.

laeva, the hand for rings, ‘ usus an-
ulorum exemptus dexterae quae multum
negotiorum gerit, in laevam [relegaba-
tur] quae otiosior est ' Ateius Capito
apud Macrob. Saturn. 7. 13.

10. inaequalis. Compare the pic-
ture of Tigellius' ‘ inconsistencies‚' ‘Nil
aequale homini fuit illi’ Sat. 1. 3. 9.

ut, after the adj.‚ as though ‘tam’
had preceded it. See on Sat. 1. 1. 95.

olavum mutaret: now the senator’s
laticlave‚ now the equestrian angusti·
clave.

in horas, ‘ from hour to hour' ;
‘mutatur in horas ⁷ A. P. 160. Cp. Od.
2. 13. 14, A. P. 62.

11. From a grand house he would
plunge suddenly into quarters from
which a freedman of any refinement
would be ashamed to be seen emerging.

13. doetus. It is with some hesita-
tion that 1 print ‘doctus‚’against ⁶ doctor‚’
the reading osthe oldest MSS. (including
the ‘ Bland.⁷) and of the Comm. Cruq.‚
who annotates ‘dieitur enim Priscus ora—
toriam docuisse.' The corruption, if it
is a corruption, is an early one. There 15
respectable authority sor ⁴ doctus‚' which
is accepted by all recent editors except
Dillr. Bentley printed ‘ doetus,' though
in his note he holds the balance even
between the two readings, ‘ nescire con-
tenti erimus.' ‘ Doctus ' is the more
natural antithesis—the ‘ man of learning‚'
against the ‘ man of loose pleasures.’

14. ‘ Born under the evil influence of
