Et paulum silvae super his foret.

Di melius fecere. Bene est.

sAT. 6. 179

Auctius atque

Nil amplius oro,

Maia nate, nisi ut propria haec mihi munera faxis.

Si neque maiorem feci ratione mala rem

Nec sum facturus vitio culpave minorem3

Si veneror stultus nihil horum: ‘O si angulus ille
Proximus accedat qui nunc denormat agellum!

O si urnam argenti fors quae mihi monstret, ut illi ιο
Thesauro invento qui mercenarius agrum

Illum ipsum mercatus aravit, dives amico

Hercule1'3 si quod adest gratum iuvat, hac prece te oro:
Pingue pecus domino facias et cetera praeter

3. paulum silvae. Cf. Od. 3. 16. 29.
Schiitz reminds us of his words ‘ Scrip-
torum ehorus omnis amat nemus' Epp.
2. 2. 773 ep.Od.1.1.30.

super his, ⁴ besides these-³

4. bene est, ‘1 am content.' It is
used with a dat. in Od. 3. 16. 43, Epp.
1. 1. 8..

5. 131aia nate. Mercury is the luck-
bringer. We are not to think here of
the special ground on which Horace
claimed his patronage, somewhat later,
as the god of the lyre3 Od. 2. 7. 13, 2.
1 . 2 .

7prgpria, ‘ my own‚' in the sense that
they are not to be taken away again : so
Od. 2. 2. 22, Virg. Ecl. 7. 31 ‘Si pro-
prium hoc fuerit.'

6. si. εΠ, as is the case,’ the apodosis

> being in v. 13 ‘hac prece te or0'3 a form

used in prayers; cp. Od. 3. 18. 1—5.

7. vitio culpave: ‘culpa' includes
errors iu judgment. Ov. Trist. 4. 1. 24
‘ Et culpam in facto, non scelus, esse
meo.’

8. veneror nihil horum. ‘ Veneror,’
in the sense of ‘to offer prayers,' is used
(1) most commonly, with obj. accus.
of the deity addressed. as in Virg. G.
1. 338 ‘in primis venerare deos.’ (23
With holla an obj. accus. and an ‘ut-'
clause. or jussive or optative subj. or a
cogn. accus. of the prayer or wish‚ as
Plaut. Aul. prol. 8 ‘venerans me ut id
servarem sibi,' Virg. A. 3. 33 ⁵ Nymphas
venerabar agrestes Rite secundarent
visus'; cp. Hor. Sat. 2. 2. 124, Caecin.
apud Cic. Fam. 6. 7. 2 ‘Multa deos
venerati sint contra suam salutem.’ Cp.
Hor. C. S. 49 n. (3) As here, with a

cogn. accus. only. The sense of ‘to
pray,’ ‘ to express a wlsh,' seems to have
been (cp. the instances from Plautus in
Fore.) historically prior to that of ‘to
reverenee‚' as it is etymologically the
original one, if the root is the same as
that of ‘ Venus' (‘ desire ').

stultus, with ‘veneron’ so that it falls
under the negative of ‘ nihil‚' ⁶ I offer no
such soolish prayer.'

9. denormat, spoils its regularity.

10. illi qui mercenarius, an in-
stance of the attraction os which Horace
is fond ; cp. Sat. 2. 2. 59 ‘ Cuius odorem
olei nequeas perferre,' and see on Epod.
2. 37 ‘to the hired labourer who,’ etc.
Horace seems to be referring to some
well—known story. We are reminded of
the parable of the treasure hid in a field
of St. Matt. 13. 44. With the wish cp.
Persius’ imitation, 2. 10 ‘O si Sub rastro
crepet argenti mihi seria, dextro Her—
cule’! which passage :see Conington's
note) also illustrates the reference to
Hercules as the giver of treasure-
trove. For this see the full note
of Ramsay’s on Plautus' Mostellaria,
4. 3. 45- Mommsen (Rom. Hist. B. 1.
ch. 12) thinks there was a confusion of
the Greek Heracles with the Sabellian
Herculus or Hercules, the god of the
homestead and so of property generally.

13. quod adest: Od. 3. 29 32. It is
questioned, but it is diffieult to decide,
whether ‘gratum' is the acc. masc. or
the nom. neut. ‘Iuvat' is used abso-
lutely in v. 32.

14. pingue, with a play on its sense
of ‘stupid;’ Sat. 1. 3. 38, Epp. 2. 1.
267.
