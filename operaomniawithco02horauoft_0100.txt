88 HORATII SATIRARUM

Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum3

Cum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque suetae

Hunc vexare Iocum curae sunt atque labori,

Quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis

Humanos animos: has nullo perdere possum 20
Nec prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum

Protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes.

Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla

Canidiam, pedibus nudis passoque capillo,

Cum Sagana maiore ululantem: pallor utrasque 25

Fecerat horrendas adspectu.

Scalpere terram

Unguibus et pullam divellere mordicus agnam

17. eum. The emphasis on ‘mihi’
gives it almost the force of ⁶ cum tamen)
‘ while yet to me.’ To the world at large
the Esquiline is now wholesome and
pleasant, but its old use has left a legacy
which to me is worse than all my other
troubles. The witches still haunt it.

suetae, not merely ‘that are wont,'
but ‘that have been wont, and so in
spite of its altered state still haunts the
place‚' just as the witches themselves
who come here still though it is no
longer a graveyard. 'she scansion of

in point because if she stood still there
would be no need to wait for her. The

24. pedibus nudis. So Medea in
Ov. Met. 7. 183 ‘Nuda pedem, nudos
humeris infusa capillos.’

25. maiore. Our doubts as to the
meaning are as old as the Scholiast.
Porph. quoting by name Helenius Acron
says that Sagana was a sreedwomau of
Pompeius (al. Pomponius), a senator
who was proscribed by the triumvirs.
No such note is found in the Acronian
scholia as we have them. He adds that
the term ‘maiore ’ implies either that
she had a younger sister, or that there
was another Sagana at the same time
‘ minorem hac vel aetate vel natalibus
vel censu.’ Aer„ in a note which
is in some confusion, gives the same
variety of meanings to ‘maiore,’ but
adds ¹ aut maiore quam fuit ipsa Cani-
dia? Is we interpret without assistance
this seems the more likely. There still
remains the doubt whether it means
‘the elder’ or ‘the greater,' i. e. ‘the
more powerful wit0h;’ or does ‘altum
caliendrum‚' v. 48, suggest the physical
sense, ‘ taller? ’
