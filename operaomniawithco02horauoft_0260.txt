248 HORATII EPISTULARUM

The story of Philippus and Volteius gives a picture to be contrasted with that
of Maecenas and Horace. It is patronage based on no intellectual sympathy
or real benevolence, but on caprice and a selfish desire for amusement. It has
the effect for the time of breaking down the sturdy independence and destroying
the contentecl simplicity of Volteius. It puts him into two false positions—first
as guest at a table where he does not understand the proprieties‚ then in a
country lise for which he has no taste or aptitude.

The story is cleverly imitated, in its outward aspect, by Swift in his ‘ Address
to the Earl of Oxford,' though a different turn is given to it; his own banishment
to the deanery of St. Patrick's being the analogue to Volteius' settlement in a
Sabine sarm.

QUINQUE dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,

Sextilem totum mendax desideror.

Atqui,

Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,

Quam mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare timenti,

Maecenas, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque 5
Dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,

Officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis

Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris, 10
Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget: te, dulcis amice, reviset

1. Quinque dies: proverbial for a
short time; Sat. 1. 3. 16. It is the
equivalent of our ‘a week,' and indi-
cates that the hebdomadal division of
time had not yet taken hold of lan-
guage.

2. Sextilem: Epp. 1. 11. 19, the
month that was subsequently named
after Augustus.

mendax: of breaking a promise;
Od. 3. 1. 30.

3. sanum reeteque valentem: Epp.
1. 16. 21. It is an habitual combina-
tion, ‘ sani sunt ac valentes ' Cic. Acad.
2. .19.

Z. das . . . dabis, ‘now’ ‘all through
the unhealthy mouth of September (Epp.
1. 16. 16) which is just coming.'

6. dissignatorem: see on Epp. 1.
5. 16. Seneca, Benef. 6. 58,joins ‘dis-
signatores et libitinarios‚⁷ the latter
being the attendants here called ‘lie-
tores atri.'

7. matercula: a fond mother.

8. officiosa sedulitas ε constant oc-
cupation in paying attention to the
great or to friends. Cp. Sat. 2. 5. 48,

6. 23 s.‚ Epp. 2. 2. 67 f. These pas-
sages illustrate also the ‘petty business
of the Forum‚’ the duties, that is, of
‘ sponsores‚’ ⁴ advocati,' ‘ testes.’

9. resignat, ‘breaks their seals,⁷ by
causing the death of the testator.

10. quodsi. For the quasi-tem-
poral use of ‘ si’ see Virg. A. 5. 64 ‘ si
nona diem mortalibus almum Aurora
extulerit‚' and Catull. ¹4- 17 ‘si lux-
erit.’ It seems to have been idiomatic,
having arisen (see Conington and Ellis
i. l.) from a ‘modest or religious way
of speaking of a future event.'

Albanis agris: the slopes of the
Alban hills.

illinet: perhaps a painter's word3
the first ‘ touches ³ of snow.

11. vates tuus. Horace throws on
Maecenas the responsibility of the title
‘ vates? Cp. Od. 1. 1. 35 ‘si me lyricis
vatibus inseres.'

12. contractus. The phrases that
seem to explain the word best are Vir-
gil's ‘contracto frigore pigrae' of the
bees² G. 4. 259, and Phaedr. 4. 23. 12
of a fly, ‘mori contractam cum te co-
