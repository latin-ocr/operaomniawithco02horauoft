HORATII SATIRARUM

Vestrum praetor, is intestabilis et sacer esto.
In cicere atque faba bona tu perdasque lupinis,
Latus ut in Circo spatiere et aeneus ut stes,
Nudus agris, nudus nummis, insane, paternis;

Scilicet ut plausus quos fert Agrippa seras tu,

Astuta ingenuum volpes imitata leonem.’
Ne quis humasse velit Aiacem, Atrida, vetas cur?

181. intestabilis et sacer, ‘ out—
lawed and accursed.' Two distinct
legal expressions put together to indi-
cate the extreme of disgrace: the first
signifying incapability of giving witness
in court 01· bequeathing property; the
second the position of a man who has
violated a ‘lex sacrata? and thereby
forfeited all rights of life and goods to
the divine powers offended. Prof. Pal-
mer notices that ‘is . . . esto ⁷ is meant
to be the formula os the oath imposed,
and quotes appositely Plaut. Mil. G. 5.
21-24 ‘ Py. Iuro per Iovem et Mavor-
tem me nociturum nemini. Pl. Quid 51
11οη faxis? Py. Ut vivam semper intes-
tabilis.’

182. eicere . . . faba . . . lupinis,
different kinds of pulse. ‘ Cicer ' occurs
in Horace's own fare, Sat. 1. 6. 1 15, and
as the fare of the humbler part of an
audience in a Roman theatre in A. P.
249. These are supposed to be thrown
to the populace to lte scrambled for, as
at the Floralia in Pers. S. 5. 176 ‘ cicer
ingere large Rixanti populo.' They are
not mentioned as a type of the largest
expenditure on such objects‚ but of the
smaller acts of largesse, which are yet
enough to ruin those who with small
sortunes try to rival the great and
wealthy in the race of bribery.

tu. Either of the sons ; the contrastis
not now between the two, but between
either of them and Agrippa, see on v. 185.

183. latus spatiere: for the literal
sense cp. Epod. 4. 8 ‘cum bis trium
ulnarum toga‚' with note thereon. Bent-
ley quoted passages to show that it had
acquired also a metaphorical sense of
walking proudly, with an air and osten-
tation, as Seu. Epist. 76 of 381015, ‘ lati
(there is a v. l. ‘ elati ”) incesserunt et
cothurnati,' etc.

in Circo. The aedile might take
a turn in the circus to be recognized and
complimented on 1115 liberality.

aeneus stes, ‘ have a statue of
bronze’3 cp. ‘levi de marmore tota . . .

stabis ' Virg. Ecl. 7. 31, and see on Od.
4. 1. 20 ‘ponet marmoream‚' Epp. 2. 1.
265 ‘proponi cereus.¹ So frequently
χαλκοῦν τινὰ ἱστάναι, as Demosth. Lept.

184. insane, the keynote of the Sa-
1118 ; but, as with ‘vesania’ in v. 174, the
point is the natural way in which the
charge comes from the lips os Op-

idius.

p 185. Agrippa: see introd. to Ode
1. 6. He was Aedile in B.C. 33, and
discharged the office with great mag-
nificenee‚ Dion 49. 43, Plin. N. H. 36.
24. 15. This allusion gives us a date
before which the Satire could not have
been written.

186. ‘Quia quod leo viribus hoe
volpes astutia agit' Acr. No fable is
found to which this is a definite refe-
rence, but Horace frequently uses in a
proverbial way the raw material of
sables.

187—223. Ambition as leading to
other crimes. The instance taken is that
of Agamemnon sacrificing Iphigenia to
effect his politieal purpose (NB. that
this is a scene vividly drawn, though
used sor another purpose. in Lucretius
1). The bearing of the act is exhibited
in a supposed dialogue between Aga-
memnon and an unknown speaker, who
expresses the views of the Stoic Ster-
tinius. The idea os this is suggested
no doubt by some Greek dramatic scene,
as that in the Ajax of Sophocles, in
which Menelaus forbids Teucer to bury
his brother Ajax (see note on v. 204).

The unknown Stoic pleads the cause of '³

Ajax by showing that though he was
admittedly mad in slaughtering the cat-
tle, Agamemnon was at least as mad in
sacrifieing his daughter. The dialogue
ends at 207. In the remaining lines the
lesson is drawn, and, though Stertinius
seems still to be addressing Agamem-
non, the application shows more visibly
through the allegory.
