LIB. Ι.

SAT. 3. 37

Saepe decern servos3 modo reges atque tetrarchas,
Omnia magna loquens; modo, ‘Sit mihi mensa tripes et
Concha salis puri et toga quae defendere frigus

Quamvis crassa queat.'

Decies centena dedisses 15

Huic parco paucis contento, quinque diebus

Nil erat in loculis.

Noctes vigilabat ad ipsum

Mane, diem totum stertebat3 nil fuit unquam
Sic impar sibi.—Nunc aliquis dicat mihi: ‘Quid tu?

Nullane habes vitia?’

Immo alia et fortasse minora. 20

Quidam ait, ‘ignoras te, an ut ignotum dare nobis

12. decem servos. A small house-
hold it would seem. The edd. quote
Val. Max. 4. 4. 11 ⁴ M. Scaurus quantu-
lam a patre hereditatem acceperit in
primo libro refert eorum quae de vita sua
scripsit. At enim sibi decem sola man—
cipia totumque censum centum quinque
ac triginta milium numorum relietum!
Cp. Horace’s own establishment‚ which
he looks on as very modest, ‘ Cena mi-
nistratur pueris tribus ' Sat. 1. 6. 1 16.

reges atque tetrarchas loquens,
having their names in his mouth, as
though he was intimate with them. Cp.
Ulysses’ rebuke of Thersites Hom. Il. 2.
250 τῷ οὐκ ἂν βασιλῆας ἀνὰ στόμ’ ἔχων
ἀγορεύοις. For the form the editors
compare Cic. ad Att. 9. 2 ‘nihil nisi
classes et exercitus loquens.’ Cp. Epp.
1. 7. 84 ‘sulcos et vineta crepat mera?

13. mensa tripes. The shape seems
to imply simplieity of fashion‚ moderate
size, and common material. Cp. Martial's
‘simplex Delphica' (12. 66. γῆ. For
the extravagance lavished on tables see
Mayor on Juv. Sat. 1. 137. The most
costly were ‘ orbes‚' i. e. round slabs or
solid sections of the trunks of trees, esp.
the ‘ citrus‚' resting on a single foot of
lvory.

14. coneha salis puri: ‘ pauperiores
in marina concha salem tritum habere
solent ' Porph. It may be doubted
whether ‘ concha ' necessarily meant an
actual shell; see Od. 2. 7. 23. The mo-
desty of the requirements lies in the
short list of his necessaries, a table, a
vessel which will hold his salt and keep
it clean (cp. Pers. Sat. 3. 25 ‘ purum et
sine labe salinum'; a saltcellar is the
one pieee of ancestral plate in a humble
home there and in Od. 2. 16. 14⁸„ and a
gown which, however coarse in material,

will keep out the cold. With ‘toga
quamvis crassa' contrast ‘tenues togae '

¹5- decies centena, sc. ‘ milia sester-
tiorum.' Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 237, 240. It
stands for a ‘good round sum-⁷ Cp.

that we should say ‘in a week‚⁷ and
that it shows that the hebdomadal divi-
sion of time had not yet got possession
of language.

17. erat for ‘esset’; Madv. § 348
c. obs. : but the indicative gives reality,
as though it were a thing that often
happened.

loculis, a easket used to carry money
and other valuables. Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 146,
Isipp. 2. 1. 175; and see Mayor on Juv.

19. aliquis. The person supposed is
someone who dislikes satire, such as
Horace argues with in Sat. 1. 4 and 2. 1.

20. immo alia. ‘ Nay‚’ Ι do not im-
ply that. I have my faults, but not the
special one which Ι speak of, ‘for all
Ι know ' less serious oneS. Horace pro-
ceeds to contrast satire with the censo-
riousness of private life. That does
imply sels-righteousness.

21. Maenius . . . Novium. Mae-
nius is the name osa Lucilian spendthrift.
See introd. to the Satires‚p. 12. Is Novius
here, as in 1. 6. 121, a usurer; the two
extremes blackeuing one another? Or
is Horace referring to some familiar
scene in a play, or to two characters
from Lucilius?

carperet, ‘was picking to pieees.'
