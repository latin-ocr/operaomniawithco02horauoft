LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 18.

Zethi, dissiluit, donec suspecta severo

Conticuit lyra.

Fraternis cessisse putatur

Moribus Amphion: tu cede potentis amici

Lenibus imperiis, quotiensque educet in agros 45
Aetolis onerata plagis iumenta canesque,

Surge et inhumanae senium depone Camenae,

Cenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta3

Romanis sollemne viris opus, utile famae

Vitaeque et membris, praesertim cum valeas et 50
Vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum

Possis.

Adde, virilia quod speciosius arma

Non est qui tractet: scis, quo clamore coronae

Proelia sustineas campestria3 denique saevam

Militiam puer et Cantabrica bella tulisti 55
Sub duce qui templis Parthorum signa refigit

Nunc, et si quid abest Italis adiudicat armis.

42. suspecta severo. The epithets
quoted as used by Zethus in the Antiope
are Μοῦσαν, ἄτοπον, ἀσύμφορον, ἀρ’γήν, φί-
λοινον, χρημάτων ἀτημελῆ. Most of the
complete lines quoted in editions as frag-
ments from the play, are the result of
conjectura] piceing together of phrases
quoted unmetrically in prose writers.

43. The words are carefully chosen
and balanced. ‘ Amphion gave way (as
we are given to believe) to the temper
of a brother and equal. You may well
yield to the commands so gently laid
on you by a powerful friend ’ top. Sat. 1.
3. 3 ‘ Caesar, qui cogere posset'). pu-
tatur (cp. ‘fertur’ Od. 3. 5. 41 with
note) throws the responsibility for the
story on the legend: ‘ poets would have
us think so.'

46. Aetolis. An instance of what is
constant in virgil, a ‘literary⁷ epithet,
not describing any characteristic of the
nets which a Roman would use, but
reminding the reader ofthe mythological
boas-hunt of Meleager in Calydon.
There is some appropriateness here in
its use in addressing a man of letters.
It seems to say ‘there are precedents
for such sports in your own poets.'

47. surge: se. Irom your ‘ lectus
lucubratorius'; cp. Sat. 1.4. 133, 1.6.122.

senium, ‘ moroseness' 3 Pers. S. 1. 26
‘en pallor seniumque,' of a poet; see
Conington's note. Cp. also ‘ senectus '
Epod. 13. 5.

48. pariter, with the whole sentence,
‘ side by side with your friend)

pulmenta, ‘ relishes,⁷ as ‘ pulmen-

taria’ in the similar ¹expression, Sat. 2.
2. 20.

49. Romanis sollemne viris opus :
an accuS. in apposition to the action
generally described in vv. 47, 48 of
which the purport is ‘go hunting.' For
the sense cp. Od. 3. 24. 54 foll„ Sat. 2.
2. ιο ⁶ Romana militia? In ⁴' Romanis
viris’ there is a suggestion that versc-
writing is after all an effeminate pursuit,
fitter for Greeks than Romans.

52. virilia arma: for ‘arma' cp.
Od. 1. 8. 10 n., A. P. 379, where also
‘corona ’ for the ring of spectators
occurs.

55. Cantabrica bella: as the next
line shows, not the campaign of Agrippa
in B.C. 20 (Epp. Ι. 12. 6), butthe expecii-
tion nominally headed by Augustus in
Β. c. 25; see introd. to Odes 1—3. 1. ξ 6,
and cp. Od. 3. 14.

56. refigit, ‘is taking down’3 cp.
‘signa Punicis adfixa delubris² Od. 3.
5. 15, and ‘clipeo relixo' Od. 1. 28.11.
The reference is to the recovcry frorn
the Parthians of the standards taken at
Charrae3 see on Epp. 1. 12. 28, Od. 4.
1 . .

5577. adiudicat: a technical term it
seems sor adjudging land in (lispute.
Cic. Off. 1. 10. 33 ‘in medio relictum
quod erat populo Romano adiudicavit.'
