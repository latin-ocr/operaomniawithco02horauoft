Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.

Cur alter fratrum cessare et ludere et ungui

Praeferat Herodis palmetis pinguibus, alter

Dives et importunus ad umbram lucis ab ortu 135
Silvestrem flammis et ferro mitiget agrum,

Scit Genius, natale comes qui temperat astrum,

Naturae deus humanae, mortalis in unum

Quodque caput, voltu mutabilis, albus et ater.

Utar, et ex modico quantum res poscet acervo

Tollam. nec metuam quid de me iudicet heres,

Quod non plura datis invenerit; et tamen idem
Scire volam, quantum simplex hilarisque nepoti
Discrepet et quantum discordet parcus avaro,

182. est qui non curat. It seems
clear that the contrast is intended to
mark the greater certainty of an indi-
vidual case; ‘I know one who cares
not.' For the grammatical difference
of the two construetions see on Od. 1.
1. 3, and compare Epp. 2. 1. 63. Horace
must mean himself, rather than (as
Orelli and Schiitz) the ‘sapiens' It
is characteristic that he goes on ‘If you
ask, why? I can't tell you, except that
men are differently constituted.'

183. alter fratrum: one even of
two brothers, whose antecedents seem
so entirely the same. Cp. Sat. 2. 1. 26
‘ Castor gaudet equis; ovo prognatus
eodem Pugnis.‘

cessare: Epp. 1. 7. 57, 1. 10. 46 n.

ungui: Od. 2. 11. 17, Epp. 1. 18.
22.

184. Herodis palmetis: i.e. to the
richest and most profitable estate. The
famous palm-groves of Jericho were
granted by Antony to Cleopatra, and
farmed for her by Herod the Great
(Joseph. Bell. Jud. 1. 18). Very pro-
bably they became his own property.
He had a palace there (Strabo 16. 44).

185. dives et importunus: rich
and yet busy in season and out of
season ; cp. Virgil's ‘labor improbus.‘

186. mitiget: so ‘ pacantur' Epp.
1. 2. 45 n.; ‘ flammis et ferro‚' though
literal of burning and ploughing, yet
have a shadow of the same metaphorical
reference to the civilizing progress of
Roman arms.

187. Genius: see on Od. 3. 17. 15,

Epp. 2. 1. 144. No Roman writer de-
scribes the idea of the Genius so clearly
as Horaee; it is born with the man, and
so makes the influence of the natal hour
what it is; it rules his life, and is the
one and only divine power that touches
it; it dies with him: it is in every
respect what he is. It is the idea of
the man's sels projected from himself
and divinized. What makes a man
what he is? When Horace answers
‘that is a secret known only to the
Genius,’ he in effect says ‘his self is
an ultimate sact; he 15 what he is;
there is no accounting for the infinite
va1·ieties of human nature.'

188. in unum quodque caput: the
‘ in ’ of reckoning‚ ‘ sor’ or ‘ with' each
single life. For the division of ⁶ unum-
quodque ' between the two lines see on
Sat. 1. 9. 51, and cp. A. P. 290.

189. albus et ater: carrying on
voltu mutabilis, ‘whatever be his
hue'; the words are proverbial: ep.
Cic. Phil. 2. 16. 41 ‘si‘qui albus aterne ιε
fuerit ignoras,' i. e. ‘one of whom you
know nothing.' So Catull. 93. 2 ‘nee
scire utrum sis albus an ater homo.'

190. utar: absolute (as Epp 1. 7. 57*
and emphatic, οἶχρῆσις opposed to κτῆσις.
So Persius S. 6. 22 ‘utar eg0‚ utar.’

192. datis: those I have given <i.e.
bequeathed) to him. Porph. took it
less simply, ‘than what he has given
to me'; cp. Sat. 2. 5: but this is to
introduce an idea alien to the context.

193. scire volam, ‘1 shall wish to
remember.'
