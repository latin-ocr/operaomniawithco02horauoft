HORATII SATI RARUM

Sisyphus ;' hunc varum distortis cruribus, illum
Balbutit scaurum pravis fultum male talis.

Parcius hic vivit, frugi dicatur.

Ineptus

Et iactantior hic paulo est, concinnus amicis 50

Postulat ut videatur.

At est truculentior atque

Plus aequo liber, simplex sortisque habeatur3

Caldior est, acres inter numeretur.

Opinor

Haec res et iungit iunctos et servat amicos.
At nos virtutes ipsas invertimus, atque 55

Sincerum cupimus vas incrustare.

Probus quis

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homog illi

47. Sisyphus: accordingto the Schol.
‘a dwarf' kept by M. Antony ‘intra
bipedalem staturam, quem ipse Sisy-
phum appellabat ob ingenii callidita-
tem.'

48. balbutit, ‘ calls fondly his “ Va-
rus,‘' his “Scaurus.'” The point seems
to be not only that these were rnild
adjectives to describe the deformity‚ but
also that they were adjectives which
give a certain heroic character to it as
recalling the names of distinguished
Roman familieS.

49. ineptus describes a man wanting
in tact. Cp. Cicero’s definition de Or.
2. 4. 17, which Horace has possibly
in mind, ‘qui aut tempus quid postulet
non videt, aut plura loquitur, aut se
ostentat, aut denique in aliquo genere
aut inconcinnus aut multus est, ineptus
esse dicitur,' where ‘ plura loquitur aut se
ostentat' recalls ‘ iactantior’ in this place.

50. concinnus seems here to mean
‘witty‚' ‘good company.‘ Cp. ‘asperi-
tas inconcinna’ in Epp. 1. 18. 6.

amicis, best taken after ‘videatur,‘
‘claims to be thought by his friends,’ etc.
Others take ‘concinnus amicis ' together
and render ‘postulat ut videatur‚‘ ‘is
wishing to be thought,' etc. i. e. ‘this is
his way of trying to make himself
agreeable ; ‘ but we are not dealing with
the motives of men but with the claims
of a friend to kindly construction.

52- simplex answers to ‘plus aequo
liber‚’ ‘ fortis ' to ‘ truculentior!

53. caldior, ‘hot-headed.' Cic. de Inv.
2. 9. 28 ‘ ideirco aliquem calidum vocari
quod temerario et repentino consilio sit.’
For the syncopated form cp. ‘soldum '
Sat. 2. 5. 65, ‘valdius' Epp. 1. 9. 6,
A. P. 321, and see on Od. 1. 36. 8.

aeres, ‘ rnen of spirit and energy.'

opinor: parenthetical as in Epp. 1.
16. 78, 2. 2. 17.

55. invertimus, ‘turn the wrong way
upwards,' ‘turn into vices.' Orelli il-
lustrates from Liv. 22. 12 ‘ [M. Minucius
L. Fabium] pro cunctatore segnem, pro
cauto timidum, affingens vicina virtutibus
vitia, compellabat.’

56. sincerum vas: Epp. Ι. 2. 54.

incrustare, ‘to cover with a film‚'
‘to foul.’ Porph. quotes from Lucilius
(3. 28) ‘ incrustatus calix?

57. multum demissus homo; illi.
There is a question of reading and a
question of interpretation, not necessarily
involved one with the other. The MSS.
generally have ‘illi‘ and the Schol.
clearly recognize it, for they interpret
‘illi . . . tardo.' The old Bland. however
had ¹ ille,’ which Cruquius defends, and
he has been followed by Bentley and of
recent editors by Ritter, Dine, Haupt
and Munro. Bentley and others of the
school which favours conj. emendation,
as Haupt, complete the reading by
inserting ‘ac’ or ‘et’ after ‘tarda⁷
Holder gives ‘ illi.’ The question of
interpretation is whether in vv. 56—58
‘ probus . . . damus ' there is one instance
of perversion of character or two.
Neither view is irreconcileable with
either ‘ ille ’ or ‘ illi ’ ; but ‘ ille ' has been
chiefly defended by those (as Bentley)
who uphold the first alternative. He
points out that what Horace is illustrat-
ing is the disposition ‘virtutes ipsas
invertere,’ not merely to give a blacker
colour to failings. The virtues he
chooses are ‘ probitas ’ ‘ prudentia,’ ‘ sim-
plicitas.' ‘Tarditas' might not be a
great fault, but it is never spoken of as a
