LIB. Ι.

EPIST. 13.

Ut cum pilleolo soleas conviva tribulis. 15
Ne vulgo narres te sudavisse ferendo
Carmina, quae possint oculos auresque morari

s. , Caesaris, oratus multa prece nitere porro.

Vade, vale, cave ne titubes mandataque frangas.

As Titinius is said to have written
⁴ togatae,’ a Roman name would be
more suitable than a Greek one. Rib-
beck conj. ‘ Proelia ' (for ‘ Procilia ³).

15. conviva tribum, i. e. one going
to be entertained as a tribesman‚ not as
an equal, but as a humbler member of
the tribe whom the rich man patronizes.
He is to be seen going to the great house,
not in a litter, nor even with a slave, but
carrying himself his felt cap for his
return at night, and the slippers (see on
Sat. 2. 8. 77) which he will put on when
he enters the house and takes off his
sandals.

16. ne narres. There is some ques—
tion as to the constr. It is perhaps best

on ‘ oratus.' ⁵ Push steadily on your
journey, remembering my earnest request
(cp. ‘rogata ' in Epp. 1. 8. 2) that you
will not tell all the world,’ etc. Others
(as Orelli, Diffi.) make ‘ne narres '
a separate imperative (see on Sat. 2. 5.
1 75 and explain ‘oratus ’ ‘though pressed
[by people to tell them].'

17. mora-ci: A. P. 321.

19. eave: see on Sat. 2. 3. 38.

titubes . . .frangas. There seems
to he a return to something of the figure
of v. 9 foll„ and there is a jest on the
brittle goods which were entrusted to
Vinius. ‘Push on, nor stop for ques-
tions. Now goodbye. But pray don't
trip and smash the poetry.' Conington.

(with Sehiitz) to make ‘ne ' dependent

ADDITIONAL NOTE.

WE may suppose that Horace has given us as much light on the circumstances
of the poem as was sufficient in his judgment for its proper appreciation. If we
would push further, several points are uncertain :

(Ι) The person ofthe messenger. Horace calls him Vinius (or ‘Vinnius'3 the MSS.
of Horace are in favour of the latter3 the MSS. of Tacitus and inscriptions in
favour of the former as the Roman gentile name) and speaks of‘ Asina’ as his
father's ‘ cognomen! The Pseudo-Acron and Comm. Cruq. call him ‘C. (⁶ Caninius'
some MSS. give} Vinnius Fronto' ; Porph. ‘Vinnius Asella) The heading of the
Epistle in the MSS. is more often ‘ad Vinnium Asellam ' (or ‘Asellum ’) than
‘ Asinam.'

Both ‘ Asina ' and ⁶ Asellus ’ were well-known ‘ cognomina'3 the former in the
family of the Scipiones (see the story in Macrob. Sat. 1. 6. 28), the latter in the
Annia and the Claudia gens. The jest on the name was a time-honoured one, for
Cicero (de Or. 2. 64. 258) quotes it as having been made by Scipio Africanus Min.
against Ti. Claudius Asellus. There is nothing else to connect the cognomen
either of Asina or Asellus with the gens Vinia, of which the first member who
became famous is the T. Vinius of Tac. Hist. 1 passim.

What relation are we to imagine Vinius as holding to Horace or to the Emperor?
The notion that he was a ‘ tabellarius ' or slave courier is excluded by v. 8, which
