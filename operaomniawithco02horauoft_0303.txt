6. sed ut, etc.: a qualification not of
‘opaca,’ which is not an epithet which
would seem to convey blame and need
explaining away, but of the whole some-
what unpromising description. It is a
valley buried among the hilis, but one
so favourably placed as to catch the
earliest and the latest sunshine. As the
valley runs from N. to S. it is clear that
if it was in the sunshine in the morning
and evening a sorlz'ori would it be so
during the day. This consideration has
been lost sight of by many commen-
tators.

dextrum . . . laevum: the right and
lest as you look down the valley.
Keller acceptS, on the authority of few
MSS„ the reading in v. 5 ‘ si ' instead of
‘ni.’ This would alter the framework
of the sentence. ‘Continui montes si
dissocientur opaca valle ’ then becomes
the protasis, ‘temperiem laudes' the
apodosiS. The result is an awkwardly
balanced and un-Horatian sentence.
And, though Keller dissents, the Scho-
liasts’ notes show them all to have read
‘ ni.'

7. currufugiente. Cp. Od. 3. 6.44.

vaporet either merely ‘ warms,’ a
sense it has in Columella 2. 15. 6 ‘glebae
solibus aestivis vaporatae‚' or of the
flickering mist caused by heat. In either
case cp. the use of ‘vapor’ in Epod.
3. 15.

8. temperiem: the tempering of the
air, high and yet warm. Cp. ‘Utrumque
rege temperante caelitum' Epod. 16. 56.

si ferant. ‘ Supposing they were to
bear‚’ i.e. supposing you were to find
that they do bear.

11. dieas ι not the direct apodosis to
‘ si ferant‚‘ for that is contained in ‘ quid.⁷

‘ Why, you would say that the rich vege·
tation of S. Italy had been brought to
our doors.'

dare nomen idoneus: for the inf.
see App. 2. vol. 1. ‘Idoneus dare ' does
not necessarily imply that it did give its
name to a river. If that were the case
it must have been named ‘Digentia.’
In any case it was a confluent. Cp.
Epp. 1. 18. 104 ‘ gelidus Digentia rivus.'

ut, in such a way that (i.e. with the
additional qualification) that it is as cool
and as pure as the Hebrus. For the use

p13. ambiat: not quite properly used of

a river which does not flow round but
through. It is meant to describe a
winding course. The Hebrus <ί hiemis
sodalis' Od. 1. 25. 11, ‘nivali compede
vinctus’ Epp. 1. 3. 3), the river of the
Bacchants <Od. 3. 25. Iol, of Orpheus
(Virg. G. 4. 524), is idealized here, and
the comparison gives to the Sabine farm
the associations of a poetic dreamland.

14. capiti . . . alvo: cp. Epp. 1. 15.
8 ‘Qui caput et stomachum supponere
fontibus audent.’ He is speaking of cold
‘ douches.’

15. dulces . . . amoenae, ‘attractive
to me‚’ ‘ lovely in themselves? ‘ Amoe-
nus’ is used by Horace of ‘ Baiae ’ Epp.
