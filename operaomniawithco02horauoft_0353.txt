LIBER SECUNDUS.

EPISTLE Ι,

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

A defence os llle Classical school of Latin Poetry.

Verses 1-4. YOU are so busy, with the Roman world on your shoulders, Caesar,
that anything Ι write to you must be short.

5-17. Like the demigods in your nastes, you are unlike them in this, that men have
recognized you for what you are in your lifetime.

18-27. But your countrymen, though they do this justice to you, are incapable
generally of doing justice to contemporaries, from their excessive regard
for the ancients. Every rag of primitive Latinity is treated as an utterance
of the Muses.

28-33. If it be pleaded that of Greek poets the oldest are the best, the answer is
plain : ‘ Are we the Greeks? ’

34-49. If it be said that generally poems, like wine, improve by time, the answer
is: Time is a relative phrase. Where will you draw the line between ancient
and modern ⁸?

50—62. There is a rage for the ancients. We know by heart all the cant epithets
for Ennius and Naevius, Pacuvius and Accius; in comedy it is Afranius,
Plautus, Caecilius, Terence. This is the orthodox list.

63-68. The admiration is too indiscrirninate.

69-75. Ι do not make a crusade against Livius whom we learned at school, but
neither do I accept him as a perfect model.

76-85. 1 do not like to see modems run down merely because they are modern,
and all criticism of aneients treated as prosanity.

86-89. This praise of antiquity is inspired by jealousy of contemporaries.

90—92. It is lueky for us that the Greeks had no such dislike of novelty, else we
should not have had the magazine which we have.

93-102. The first use they put their leisure to was to essay first one art, then
another, with the freshness and the inconstancy of a child.

103—107. At Rome we were more serious: domestic duties‚ morals, (and a little
money-gettingff, occupied our countrymen in old days.

108—117. Now no doubt the tide has turned and we are all scribbling, young and
old, fit and unfit.

118—138. Well, there is something to be said after all for poetry. There are
worse madnesses. It has even its uses, in education, as a practical teacher
of philosophy, in religion.
