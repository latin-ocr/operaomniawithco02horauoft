HORATII EPISTULARUM

Sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt3
Plebs eris.. At pueri ludentes, ‘Rex eris,' aiunt,

‘Si recte facies.³

Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa. ¹· ·

Roscia, dic sodes, melior lex an puerorum est .

Nenia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,

Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis? ’

60. si recte facies. The Scholiast
gives the full line of the ‘nenia,' a
trochaic tetrameter catal., ‘Rex eris si
recte facies, si non facies, non eris‚' and
the same verse is quoted as a proverb by
Isidore of Seville §beginning of 7th cent.)
