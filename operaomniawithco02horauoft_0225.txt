EPISTLE Ι.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

THE Epistle is written for its place. It is the dedication to Maecenas of the
First Book of the Epistles‚ and it is an apology (1) for his change of style—from
the Odes to the Epistles; (2) for the subject-matter of his new compositions. He
has outgrown the power and taste for lyric poetry. His soul is set now on attain-
ing a philosophy of lise. He has not done so ; but short of that, he would make
the most of such eclectio and elementary fragments of truth as he has made his
own. It is his own mind and lise that he professes to be thinking of; but it is
implied that his compositions will reflect his new tastes.

Verses 1-6. You have every claim on me, Maecenas, and Ι have always acknow—
ledged it; but what you ask of me now is to shut the door of the training
school again on a gladiator who has earned his discharge.

7-9. I arn for turning a horse out to grass in time, before he breaks down.

10—12. So now I am laying down lyric poetry as one of my playthings. Ι am
thinking now of philosophy, with a practical aim.

13—19. Do not suppose that this means that I have a system cut and dried. I am
still an eclectio. At one time I think myself a Stoic, at another Ι relapse into
Epicureanism.

20-26. 1 am impatient for the day when Ι may accomplish the most serious work
of life by attaining a true philosophieal scheme.

27. Meanwhile Ι would guide and comfort myself with such rudimentary lessons
as these.

28—32. A little is better than nothing—especially in a medicinal art.

33—40. There is no passion that does not admit of mitigation if the patient will
submit to treatment.

41—47. Humble and negative as this is, it is the first necessary step to virtue and
wisdorn. If only men were as eager to escape wrong desires as they are to
escape poverty!

49-31. On all analogy they should be so; for the prize offered is greater, the
effort required less, for virtue is to gold as gold is to silver.

52—56. Unfortunately the opposite doctrine is preached by the business world of
Rome and learnt eagerly by all classes, ’

57—64. The arrangements of social rank go the same way. Your place depends
on your money. How much better our boys could teach us with their
nursery jingle ‘ Rex eris si recte facies.' That is sounder than the law of Otho.

68, 69. Which is the better adviser, one who says, ‘ Make money without regard to
the means‚' or one who says (and teaches you how to do it), ¹ stand up like
a man and sace fortune’?
