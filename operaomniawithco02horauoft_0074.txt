62 HORATII SATIRARUM

Differtum nautis, cauponibus atque malignis.

Hoc iter ignavi divisimus, altius ac nos 5
Praecinctis unum: minus est gravis Appia tardis.

Hic ego propter aquam, quod erat deterrima, ventri

Indico bellum, cenantes haud animo aequo

Exspectans comites.

Iam nox inducere terris

Umbras et caelo diffundere signa parabat. ιο
Tum pueri nautis, pueris convicia nautae

Ingerere. ‘ Huc appellel'
Iam satis est!'
Tota abit hora.

‘Trecentos inseris: ohe
Dum aes exigitur, dum mula ligatur,
Mali culices ranaeque palustres

Avertunt somnOS, absentem ut cantat amicam 15
Multa prolutus vappa nauta atque viator
Certatim. Tandem fessus dormire viator

4. nautis, cauponibuS, because it
was a stopping-place where travellers
einbarked on the canal. Strabo 5. 3. 6
describes the canal which ran by the
side os the Via Appia through the
Pomptine marshes to within a short dis-
tance of Tarracina. It was used chiefly
for night travelling, the boats being
dragged by mules.

malignis: see Sat. 1. 1. 29 n.

5. hoc iter, i. e. the joumey from
Rome to Appii Forum.

altius praecinctis = ‘ expeditioribus}
a humorous adaptation of the measure—
ment of distance in Hdt. and Thue.
εὐζώνῳ ἀνδρί, as though all travellers
went on foot.

6. minus gravis. Horace speaks,
Epp. 1. 17. 53, of the roughness (⁴ sale-
bras ') of the road to Brundisium.

tardis: those who take it in short
stages.

7. deterrima. ‘Hodie quoque in
Foro Appii viatores propter aquam quae
ibi deterrima est manere vitant’ Porph.
The badness of the water is explained
by the neighbourhood of the marshes.
Notice that the custom of mixing water
with wine is so fixed that Horace does
not get out of the difficulty by drinking
his wine neat, but goes without his
supper.

9. comites. Not his own party, for
at present Heliodorus alone was with
him, but others, possibly who had
arrived before, who were to share the
boat.

iam nox, etc.· The heroic tone of

this verse and the next is meant to
heighten by contrast the humour of the
Dutch picture which follows, just as the
⁴ Musa velim memores' of v. 53 intro-
duces the vulgar sparring of the clowns.

11. pueri nautis. The scene shifts
from the supper room to the landing—
place of the canal. ‘Pueri’ are the
slaves in attendance on travellers, ‘ nau-
tae,' men in charge of the barges in
which the journey was made.

12. huc· appelle, of a slave hailing
a boat.

trecentos inseris. Not an answer
to ‘huc appelle‚' but another utterance

distinguished in the babel of voices, of
