LIB. Ι. SAT. 9. 91

SATIRE IX.

THE WRONG WAY TO MAECENAS’ FRIENDSHIP.

THE sufferings of Horace under the hands of a ‘ bore’ are the amusing part os
the Satire, but they are only the dramatic setting of the true subject. In Sat. 6 he
told the story of his own admission to the intimacy of Maecenas, how small a part
he had himself had in it, how natural and consistent with sels-respect had been
every stage in it. He completes the matter by this contrasted picture of the way
in which vulgar and pushing people vainly hoped to gain an entry. The person
described is a man of letters (v. 7), but of a type which Horace despised⁷ fluent,
vain, and effeminate rvv. 23—25). His obtuseness and want of tact are displayed
in his acts, and he is made to paint with his own lips and in perfect unconscious-
ness the meanness of purpose and method which Horace had in view when he said
(Sat. 1. 6. 51) that Maecenas was careful ‘ dignos assumere, prava ambitione
procul': ‘ He will miss no opportunity, he will take no refusal, he will bribe the
servants if Horace will help him he will go shares‚ and together they will oust
all rivals.’ He was painting by contrast the lise in Maecenas’ house, as well as the
avenues to it (v. 48). Horace must often have had requests from such people to
introduce them to the great patron of literature, and this is his answer to them.
His own tact had taught him the lesson which he passes on to a younger generation
in Epp. Ι. 18. 76 ‘ Qualem commendes etiam atque etiarn aspice.'

The occasion imagined sor the scene is when Horace is taking his morning stroll
(⁴ ad quartam iaceo: post hanc vagor’ 1. 6. 122). He is walking, as it chauces,
on the Sacra Via towards the Forum. When they reach (v. 18) the entrance to it,
close by the Temple of Vesta their paths diverge, for his interlocutor was bound
for the Forum to appear in a case, and Horace, who had announced that he was
going to pay a visit on the other side of the Tiber, would leave the Sacra Via at
that point, and turn round the side of the Palatine towards the river.

Horace is probably dramatizing an imaginary situation, or at least improving
some slighter incident; but attempts have been made to guess the particular
person intended. The only noteworthy suggestion is that Propertius is intended
(see on Sat. 1. 3. 30, Epp. 2. 2. 100). The dates make this next to impossible.
If the Satires were published in B.C. 36 Propertius would, according to the most
probable chronology, be only 16. Propertius was admitted to Maecenas' circle
probably about the year 30.

IBAM forte via Sacra, sicut meus est mos,
Nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis.

the sense here.
totus in illis, ‘ absorbed in them.'

1. via Sacra. Epod. 4. 7.
sicut meus est mos, with the words

that follow,—‘ thinking, as is my wont
when walking ’—not with ‘ ibam‚' which
would contradict ‘ forte.’

2. meditans nugarum. Both words
are used of poetical composition (Epp.
2. 2. 71, 76, 141), and this is possibly

Epp. Ι. 1. 11 ‘ omnis in hoc sum.' Some
MSS. of inferior value insert ‘et ' before
‘totus‘ Bentley wished to read ‘ ut ’
after ‘ ibam ' ; but in both cases the
asyndeton belongs to the negligent style
of familiar narration.
