LIB. II. EPIST. 2. 371
Alterius sermone meros audiret honores,

Qui minus argutos vexat furor iste poetas? 90

Carmina compono, hic elegos.

16. 12, there is an adjective present, the
‘ut' clause measuring or limiting its
applicability‚ ‘ [tam] dives ut metiretur
nummos,' ‘ [ita] idoneus ut nec frigidior
Thracam . . . ambiat Hebrus! If the
text is sound‚ (and the MSS. are unani-
mous and the Scholiasts read as we do‚)
we must suppose that such an adjective
is latent in ‘s1·ater‚⁷ not that ‘frater’ is
merely metaphorical (like ‘fraternis
animis’ in Epp. 1. 10. 4), but that it
carries the sense of a ‘brother indeed.'
This is helped by its emphatic position.
‘ There were at Rome a lawyer and a
rhetorician, such brothers that when one
spoke the other heard nothing but com-
pliments.' Heinsius was the first to
complain of the construction and to
suggest emendation. Bentley took up
the challenge and would read ‘Pactus
erat Rornae consulto rhetor.' Meineke
suggested that a line had dropped out
and proposed ‘ Frater erat Romae con-
sulti rhetor ut[erque Alterius laudum
sic admirator ut] alter Alterius,' etc.
Schiitz suggests the easier alteration of
⁵ Fautor' (an Horatian word, see Sat. 1.
10. 2 ; Epp. 1. 15. 33, 1. 18. 66, ²·1·23)
sor ‘ Frater.’ Prof. Palmer (ap. wilkins)
‘auctor erat consulto] In face of the
early evidence to the text it does not
seem a case sor conjectural emenda-
tion.

89. Gracchus, ‘a Gracchus.' Both
the brothers were speakers. Cicero
(Brut. 33. 124) specially praises Gaius.

Mucius, i.e. ‘ a great lawyer.’ There
were three of the family who attained
great distinction as 4 iurisconsulti.' (1)
P. Mucius Scaevola consul in 133; (2)
a cousin, Q. Mucius Scaevola called
‘ Augur‚' consul in 117, an interlocutor
in Cicero's ‘ de Amicitia '; (3) Q. Mucius
Scaevola, son 0111), and, like 1115 father,
‘ pontifex maximus,' consul in 95. From
the fact that Cicero (Brut. 39. 145)
speaks of a case in which Crassus
‘eloquentium iuris peritissimus,’ and
Scaevola (i. e. no, 3) ‘iuris peritorum
eloquentissimus‚' were matt-hed against
one another, Bentley suggested that in
this line we should read ·Crassus ’ for
‘ Gracchus!

‘ Mirabile visu

† huic .. . illo. All the extant MSS.
have ‘ hic . . . illi ' in both clauses. This
is not absolutely impossible. Either ‘ hic
. . . hie ² or ‘illi . . . illi ’ alone sor ‘ the
one . . . the other,' 4 to the one . . . to
the other,‘ would be usual, but the
repetition of ‘hic illi’ where the two
pronouns change places has not been
paralleled. In spite of this Ritter re-
tains the reading and Keller shows some
tenderness towards it. If Horace can
be conceived as writing it he rnay have
meant to emphasize the monotony of the
shuttlecock compliments. The altera-
tion is however slight and the reading of
the MSS. (cp. a similar case in Epod. 4.
8 ‘ ter ' sor ‘trium ’) may have arisen from
the mistaken expansion of an abbrevia-
tion. ‘ Huic . . . ille ' is said to be due
to the edition of ‘Iohannes Britanni-
cuS,’ Venet. 1516. It was adopted by
Lambinus, and advocated by Bentley,
and thenceforward has been generally

91. carmina compono. ‘ Carmina'
are lyrical poems, as we see from v. 99
‘ discedo Alcaeus.' Horace playsully
takes his own share in the charge. Is
he laying the indictment against the
writers ot elegies more seriously and with
a special person in view? Torrentius
first pointed out that the name of‘ the
Roman Callimachus’ (v. 100) was one
which is actually claimed sor himself by
Propertius, and this clue has been fol-
lowed by editors, Ritter especially, who
see in the passage an elaborate attack on
that poet. For a full statement of the
evidence in this passage of a reference to
Propertius see Postgate's Introd. to his
Select Elegies of Propertius. Propertius
was a member of Maeeenas' literary
circle and therefore must have been
well known to Horace, who nevertheless
never names him. Isthis view is correct,
Horace will say ‘we poets laud one
another. We use extravagant terms in
speaking of one another's poems. We
