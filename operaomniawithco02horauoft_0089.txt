Esse in amicorum numero.

sAT.6 77

Magnum hoc ego duco

'Quod placui tibi, qui turpi secernis honestum,

Non patre praeclaro, sed vita et pectore puro.

Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis 65
Mendosa est natura alioqui recta, velut si

Egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos;

Si neque avaritiam neque sordes nec mala lustra

Obiciet vere quisquam mihi, purus et insons

(Ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis; 70
Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello

Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni

Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,

Laevo suspensi-²loculos tabulamque lacerto,

Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aera: 75

63. turpi . . . honestum. Perh. Epp.
1. 9. 4 ⁶ legentis honesta Neronis‚' shows
that these are more probably neut. than
maso. (as Orelli).

65. atqui. ‘ But yet‚' do not misunder-
stand me. Even when I say that 1 am
proud to owe your friendship to myself,
not to my father, I am indirectly ex-
pressing my obligation to him, for I
owe him ‘my own self.’

ae mea paucis: for the hyperbaton
cp. Sat. 1. 549 ‘pila lippis inimicum et
ludere crudi‚' and below vv. 69. 70.

68. nee. The reading of V. The
vulg. is ‘ ac,' which Bentley rightly ob-
jected to; ‘sordes' <‘1neanness‚’ see v.
107) is the opposite vice to ‘ mala
lustra‚' ‘haunts of debauehery.' Bentl.
adopted ‘ aut‚' which Orelli retains.

7ο. collaudem: perh. in its simplest
sense, praise myself too, i. e. as well as
my father.

nusm.

magni . . . magnis, ‘both bigger and
grander than Ι was.'

74. loculos has been taken either
as=the ‘capsa’ of Juv. Sat. 10. 117
‘ quem sequitur custos angustae ver-
nula capsae,' of a case containing books,
writing materials. ete, or in its more
usual sense (see on Sat. 1. 3. 17) osa re-
ceptacle for money, here probably for
counters. In the former ease ‘ tabula’
will be a writing tablet (cp. δελτὸν ἑφ-
αψάμενοι, quoted by Mayor from Philo-
stratus). In the latter it 1111151 be taken

more closely with ‘ loculos’ as the
‘abacus' or counting boardz on which
the counters were to be placed. The
two will then describe the implements
for the arithmetie lesson ; cp. A. P. 325.
The line is repeated Epp. 1. 1. 56.

75. octonis Idibus aera. There is
serious question as to both reading and
sense. If we keep the vulgate it is best
explained (566 Bekker’s Gallus, Excursus
on ‘Education') of the monthly pay-
ments and four months' summer holidays
of country schools as contrasted with 1116
yearly payment and full year's school-
ing in Rome, ‘ bringing their sees on the
Ides of eight months.' The distributive
is used regularly sor the cardinal nu-
meral with a noun which is plural in
form even when singular in sense, as
‘ bina castras etc. In Orelli's explana-
tion, ‘ eightday Ides,' ⁴ quia Idus in oc—
tavum post Nonas diem incidunt,’ it is
difficult to feel any ground for the dis-
tributive. An alternative reading is
found in a few good MSS, and is given
by Keller. ‘ octonos Idibus aeris.' where
‘aeris’ is equivalent to ‘asses’ as in
Cic. pro Q. Rosc. 10. 28 ‘duodecim
aeris.’ The distributive then means
‘eight asses on each Ides.’ This read-
ing seems to be interpreted by Aer.
‘ nummos pro mercedibus, octonos asses
aeris? On the other hand the note of
the Comm. Cruq. shows that he found
