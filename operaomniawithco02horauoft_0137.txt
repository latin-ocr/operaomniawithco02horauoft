Galloni praeconis erat acipensere mensa

Quid? tunc rhombos minus aequora alebant?

Tutus erat rhombus tutoque ciconia nido

Donec vos auctor docuit praetorius.

Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos,
Parebit pravi docilis Romana iuventus.
Sordidus a tenui victu distabit, Ofello

Si te alio pravum detorseris.

Avidienus‚

Cui Canis ex vero ductum cognomen adhaeret,

his which are preserved in Cic. de Fin.

2. 8. 2

⁴ O Pu4bli, o gurges Galloni: es homo
miser, inquit3

Cenasti in vita nunquam bene, cum
omma ln ista

Consumis squilla atque acipensere cum
decumano?

See above on v. 20. The point is

that the standard of luxurious living

varies from age to ane. This is notice-

ably confirmed by Pliny, N. H. 9. 27.

who says that the ‘ acipenser ’ had ceased

in his time to be valued.

47. erat. For lengthening of syllable
see on Sat. 1. 4. 82.

49. tuto . ..nido, deser. ablative,
Madv. ξ 272, ‘the stork found its nest-
lings safe.'

50. auctor.. ‚praetorius The Scho-
liasts give various names in explanation
—Plotius Plancus, Aselliusffiempronius.
In one of several contradictory notes
Porph. says that the person meant is
one Rufus, who had set the fashion of
eating young storks, and who, being
defeated for the praetorship, was made
the object of the following epigram.
⁵ Ciconiarum Rufus iste conditor. Hic est
duobus elegantior Plancis: Suffragiorum
puncta non tulit septem. Ciconiarum po-
pulus ultus est mortem.' ‘Praetorius‚'
if the person meant was an unsuccessful
candidate for the praetorship, must be
i1·0nical; but the guesses are evidently
of little value.

51. edixerit, ‘with a praetor's au-
thority.' Cp. Epp. 1. 19. 10.

mergos, ‘divers‚' birds of hard and
unsavoury flesh.

assos (‘ardeo’)‚ roasted or broiled‚
i.e. cooked in the way that suits only
the tenderer and more delicate meatS.

52- pravi docilis. The gen. as in

Od. 4. 6. 43 ‘ docilis modorum.' Schutz
points out that ‘docilis ' answers to ‘ do—
cuit' in v. 50, as ·edixerit’ answers to
‘ praetorius.’

Romana iuventus. Orelli notices the
irony of using here this heroic title, fre-
quent in Ennius, as in Ann. 538 · optima
cum pulcris animis Romana iuventus)

53. It is not meant in satirizing luxury
to recommend meanness.

distabit. The best supported reading
is ‘distabat'3 but, in spite of Bentley's
sanction, few editors have given it. Kel-
ler considers ‘ distabit ' a necessary emen-
dation3 ‘distabat’ could hardly mean
‘ differed in Ofellus' judgment,' which
is an English not a Latin idiom, and
the following tense ‘ vitaveris ' excludes
the impft. The future leaves open the
question whether Ofellus is supposed
to be speaking throughout or not. 1f

so (as I have assumed) ¹ Ofello iudiee' Ξ [θα {z

‘ me iudice.'

55. alio, ‘ in another direction ’ ;
Sat. 2. 1. 32.

pravum, proleptic‚ so as to go
crooked.

Avidienus. The following words
seem to show that a real person is in-
tended. If so, the name is probably
fictitious, possibly carrying in it a clue
to contemporaries. For the supposed
derivation of the name from ‘avidus'
see introd. to the Satires, p. 14.

56. Canis. Cf.‘canisimmundus'Epp.
1. 2. 263 in reference to the dog as a
foul feeder. Possibly the person in-
tended had one of his real names from
‘ Canis‚' as Canidius, Caninius, Canius,
Canina.

ex vero, no meaningless jest.

ductum. The reading of V„ against
the more common ‘ dietum.’ Cf. Sat. 2.
1. 66. So Bentl. and Munro.
