LIB. Ι. SAT. 1. 23
Ut tibi 51 sit opus liquidi non amplius urna,
Vel cyatho, et dicas, ‘Magno de flumine mallem 55

Quam ex hoc fonticulo tantundem sumere.'

Eo fit,

Plenior ut si quos delectet copia iusto,

Cum ripa simul avulsos ferat Aufidus acer.

At qui «tantuli eget quanto est opus, is neque limo
Turbatam haurit aquarn, neque vitam amittit in undis. 60
At bona pars hominum decepta cupidine salso

‘Nil satis est,’ inquit, ‘quia tanti quantum habeas sis.’

Quid facias illi ?

Iubeas miserum esse libenter

Quatenus id facit: ut quidam memoratur Athenis
'Sordidus ae dives, populi contemnere voces 65
Sic solitus: ‘Populus me sibilat; at mihi plaudo
'lpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca?

54. urna . . . cyatho : both liquid
measures3 the ‘ urna’ being 24 sextarii or
half an ‘amphora,' i. e. a little less than
3 gallons‚ the ‘ e>athiis' being 1¹²2 of the
‘ sextarius,’ ‘ half a wine-glass.'

55. mallem. ‘ I could wish if 1 had
the ehoice.’ This is the best supported
reading. Some MSS. have ‘malim,'
and Dillr. and Munro amongst other
editors prefer it. The picture is not so
much at the moment of a man choos-
ing between offered lots as of one dis-
satisfieri with his own. The answer in
the next sentence 15, ‘let him have his
ehoice and it will osten end in his ruin.’

56. tantundem, though it be exactly
the same quantity.

eo fit, ‘so it comes to pass)
similitude has passed into a sable.

58. Aufidus acer,‘viole1is’ Od. 3.
30. 10, ‘longe sonans' Od. 4. 9. 2, ep.
4. 14. 25; the Aufidus stands with
Horace generally for a mountain torrent
in flood: see vol. i. p. 36.

59. neque limo turbatam, a point
added to the original image. 'l'he
flooding river is muddy as well as
dangerous; ‘allegorice sordidos quaes-
tus,' Acr.: the dirt which has to be
{wallowed by one who makes haste to

e rich.

61, 62. The third argument of the
hoarder.

61. bona pars: cp. A. P. 297: ‘bona
pro magna dictum, ut saepe Ennius et
alii veteres‚' Porph. Lucretius (5. 1025)

The

and Terence (Eun. 1. 2. 43) have ‘ bona
magnaque pars '; Cic. de Or. 2. 3 ‘ bo-
nam partem sermonis.'

cupidine salso, as ‘pravi' Od. 3.
24. 5¹ ; ‘mistaken⁷: for the gendes see
on Od. 2. 16. 15.

62. tanti quantum habeas sis.
The miser is quoting (it seems) Lucilius
(incert. 5. 22, recovered suom Schol.
on JuV. S. 3. 142) ⁵ quantum habeas tan-
tum ipse sies tantique habeaxis) The
mood is probably the same as in the
original, ‘sis'=&v εἴης. Heindorf ex-
plains it as a return, aster ‘inquit‚' to
the orat. obliqua.

63. illi, the man who as the repre-
sentative of the ‘bona pars’ is sup-
posed to have answered ‘nil satis
est) Bentley would read ‘miseram,‘
5ο that ‘illi' may refer direetly to the
‘bona pars.’ For the dat. cp. Cic.
pro Caec. 11. 30 ‘quid huic tu homini
iacias?⁷

64. quatenus, ‘ inasmuch aS,' Od. 3.
24. 3o; Sat. 1. 3. 76, 2. 4. 57. Itake
the opportunity of correcting a careless
misstatement in my first edition on
the first of these passages. Jt is a fre-
quent 1156 111 Lucretius; see Munro on
2. 92 .

id 7facit, sc. ‘ miser est.’ Sat. 1. 4. 79.
Such sels-dilusion is impenetrable; bring
home to him the fact that the world
does not estimate him the higher sor
his weahh, he only falls back on 1115
own approbation.
