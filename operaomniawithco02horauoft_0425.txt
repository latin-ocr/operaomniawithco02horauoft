Nondum spissa nimis complere sedilia flatu3

Quo sane populus numerabilis, utpote parvus,
Et frugi castusque verecundusque coibat.
Postquam coepit agros extendere victor et urbes
Latior amplecti murus vinoque diurno

Accessit numerisque modisque licentia maior;

as here and in Cicero, of a metal of the
day it seems to have meant brass. There
is an interesting passage in Plin. N. H.
16. 66, in which he describes the treat-
ment of reeds sor making flutes ‘ so long
as they used simple music: and their
more elaborate process ‘ postquam vari-
etas aceessit et cantus quoque luxuria,
apertioribus earum ligulis ad flectendos
sonos'; the difficulty, he says, being such
that it was not to be wondered at that
people had taken to use silver as better
material.

203. foramine pauco, for ‘ paucis
foraminibus,’ according to the use of
‘ multus’ see Epod. 2. 31 ‘multa eane,’
Od. 4. 5. 33 ‘multa prece,⁷ and see on
Od. Ι. 7. 8. Aer. quotes Varro as say-
ing that the ‘tibia' in old times had
four stops, and that he had seen one
with that number in the temple of
Marsyas.

204. adspirare et adesse: the two
verbs are not to be too nicely distin-
guished. ‘ Adspirando adesse,' i. e.
⁴ opitulari,’ ‘to support by accompani-
ment!

205. spissa sedilia:
41.

206. sane indicates that we are hear-
ing the point of ‘ nondum spissa nimis ;'
the matter is brought home to the
character of the audience.

numerabilis, a word not found before
Horace, εὐαρίθμητος.

utpote parvus explains not ‘numera-
bilis' but ‘numerabilis coibat.’ The
people carne in numbers that could be
counted because the people itself was
small.

207. et frugi, etc. And those who
came were of a better class than modern
audiences. These adj. also go with
‘coibatss Orelli suggests that castus-
que verecundusque implies that the
religious origin of the drama was better

remembered. ‘Castus' is used greatly
of piety towards the gods, ‘ castus
Aeneas ² C. S. 42, so Virg. Aen. 3. 409
‘ Hac casti maneant in religione nepotes.'
Cp. ‘ incestus⁷ inf. v. 472.

208. vietor: the subj. is still ‘po-
pulus '; ‘ when its conquests were over.⁹
Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 93 foll. and 162. The
two expressions ‘ agros extendere ' and
‘latior murus,' imply the growth of
population, rustic and urban ; the
theatrical audiences then became much
larger and more mixed.

urbes: so all MSS. of any value.
Bentl. would substitute ‘urbem‚' but
Horace is, iu profession at least, sketch-
ing the history of the Greek drama as
much as the Roman, although the ex-
pressions, no doubt, suit better the
gradual expansion of Rome, than any
known facts in Greek history.

209. vino diurno : Sat. 2. 8. 3 ‘de
medio potare die) It refers to what
Cicero calls ‘tempestiva convivia,' e. g.
pro Mur. 6. 13, drinking that began
before the proper business hours were
over.

210. placari Genius: see on Epp.
2. 1. 144.

impune : ‘ non contradicente aut lege
aut moribus ’ Aer.

2 1 1. numerisque modisque, ῥυθμοῖς
καῖ μέλεσι. The two together stand for
the music. See on Epp. 1. 18. 59.

lieentia maior. Cicero complains
of the lower standard of the music of
the theatre in his time: Leg. 2. 15. 39
