HORATII SATIRARUM

Laudatur ab his, culpatur ab illis.

Fufidius vappae famam timet ac nebulonis,

Dives agris, dives positis in fenore nummis:

Quinas hic capiti mercedes exsecat atque

Quanto perditior quisque est tanto acrius urget3 ιε
Nomina sectatur modo sumpta veste virili

Sub patribus duris tironum.

‘Maxime‚' quis non,
‘Iuppitert' exclamat simul atque audivit?
Pro quaestu sumptum facit hic?

‘At in se
Vix credere possis

Quam sibi non sit amicus, ita ut pater ille, Terenti 20
Fabula quem miserum gnato vixisse fugato

Inducit, non se peius cruciaverit atque hic.

Si quis nunc quaerat, ‘Quo res haec pertinet?’ illuc:
v[Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt.

Maltinus tunicis demissis ambulat; est qui 25

11. laudatur ab his, as Tigellius by
the street—singem, etc. The point is not
that his conduct is variously judged.
but that he only attains the praise of
one party at the expense of incurring
blame from another. In his dread of
being thought mean he becomes extra-
vagant.

12. FufidiuS, ⁸ avarus quidam fenera-
tor’ Schol.

vappae ae nebulonis, Sat. 1. 1. 104.

13. The line recurs in A. P. 421. For
positis cp. Epod. 2. 70.

14. quinas mercedes: five interests,
i.e. five times the usual interest. This
was ‘centesimae usurae,’ one per cent.
per mouth, or 12 per cent. per annum.
This usurer exacted 60 per cent. With
the expression cp. ‘ binae centesimae,’
i.e. 24 per cent. Cic. Verr. 2. 3. 71. 165.

capiti exsecat. Porph. explained,
‘ slices off,' ‘deducts from thecapita17' i.e.
in lending the money he deducts at once
the first month's interest. Orelli and
Ritter object to this explanation that it
ignores the distributive force of ‘ quinas‚‘
uhich ought to imply ‘on each occa-
sion,' and therefore take it in the more
general sense as a stronger form of ‘ ex-
toiquet.' It rec-alls Seneca's phrase
(Benef. 7. 10) ‘sanguinolentas usuras‚’
‘that draw blood.’ ‘ He draws from
his prineipal, even if it takes a knise to
do it, five times the usual interest.’

16. nomina sectatur, i. e. he tries to

get their names into his books as bor-
rowers. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 105 ‘cautos no-
minibus rectis nummos.'

17. tironum. The words ⁴ tiro' and
‘tirocinium' are used frequently of the
moment when a young man exchanged
the ‘ praetexta ’ for the ‘ toga pura ’ or
‘ virilis? and especially of a ceremony
with which the change was accompanied
when he was led into the forum by his
father, ‘deductus in iorum tiro’ Suet.
Ner. 7.

19. pro, ‘in proportion to.'

20. pater ille, Menedemus in the
Heautontimorumenus.

24. The key line of the Satire. Cp.
the argument in Sat. 1. 1. 101 foll. It
is implicitly the Aristotelian doctrine of
virtue lying in the mean ε see Epp. 1.
18. 9.

25. Maltinus. The MSS. and the
Scholiasts are (livided between the
forms Maltinus (or Malthinus) and
Malchinus. Maltinus is said to be de-
rived from ⁴1nalta‚' a Lucilian word for
an effeminate person, but Maltinus is a
Roman name found in history and in
inscriptions For the traditional reser-
ence of the line to Maecenas see Intro-
duction and Introd. to the Satires. p.
6. Seneca, Epist. 114. 6. says that it
was recorded of Maecenas that he al-
ways walked in Rome ‘solutis tuni-
eis.
