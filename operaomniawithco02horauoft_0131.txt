SAT. 2. 1¹9

Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum:
Si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, ius est

Iudiciumque.'

Esto, si quis mala3 sed bona si quis

Iudice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis
Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse? 35
‘Solventur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis.'

81. incutiat: see above on v. 39.

82. si mala condiderit. Horace
seems to be referring to the actual
words of the XII Tables, for Cicero, de
Rep. 4. 10. 12 (preserved by Augustine,
(16 Civ. Dei 2. 9) has ‘Nostrae duo-
decim tabulae cum perpaucas res eapite
sanxissent in his quoque sanciendum
putaverunt si quis occentavisset sive
carmen condidisset quod infamiam fa-
ceret flagitiumve alteri? Horace refers
to the same law in Epp. 2. 1. 153.

84. iudice Caesel-esan abl. absol.;
see on Od. 1. 6. 2.

85. latraverit, for ‘allatraverit,’ as
in Epod. 5. 58, Epp. 1. 2. 65. For
the implied comparison of a satirist
to a watchdog see on Epod. 6. 1.

integer, Od. 1. 22. 1.

86. solventur tabulae. The general
sense is plain, but the figure employed
is uncertain. There is an apparent
reference to the phrase in Quintil. 5.
ιο. 67 ‘ Cum risu tota res solvitur.‘

SATIRE II.

v OFELLUS, OR PLAIN LIVING.

Verses 1—16. ‘ LISTEN, my friends, to a lecture on plain living '—it is not Horace
speaking, but Ofellus—a plain man, but a philosopher in his way—‘ listen,
but not in a smartly laid out dining-room nor when your bellies are full. Go
and hunt, or break a rough horse, or (if you are only fit for such effeminate
exercises) have a good game of ball or quoit, and then Ι defy you to despise
plain fare.

16-2 2. Hunger is the best sauce. The rarest delicacies lose their flavour if appetite
is wanting.

227-30. It is, I suppose, useless to protest against the preference of a peacock to
a bamdoor fowl. It is more eostly and appeals to the eye. Even that is
ridiculous, for you are not going to eat the smart seathers. But your sancies
about sood go farther still.

31-39. You think you know whether the pike is caught in the river or in the sea.
You like your mullet large (though you must divide it to eat it) and your pike
small. Your only principle is to take what is rare and avoid what is natural.
That comes from not knowing what it is to be really hungry.

39-44. You say you like to gloat over the big dishfull. One is inclined to call
the south wind to taint the glutton’s dainties3 but there is no need: boar and
turbot lose all their savour when the stomaeh is tired3 then you prefer
herbs.

44-52. Princes and peasants share the taste sor eggs and olives. The sact is.
that it is greatly a matter of fashion. The nastiest dish can be made the
vogue.

53—69. There is a great distinction in my judgment between plain living and mean
living, forthere are faults on both sides. You need not be like Avidienus.
