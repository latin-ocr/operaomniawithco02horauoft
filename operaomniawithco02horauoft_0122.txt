LIBER SECUNDUS.

SATIRE Ι.

TREBATIUS, OR THE RIGHT AND WRONG OF SATIRE.

AN apology for Satire, and (as befits the beginning of a Second Book) for
Satire that has given offence. Itis put in the form of a consultation with a shrewd
old lawyer.

Verses 1-5. H. My Satires are criticised—sometimes as too fieree, sometimes as
too feeble—advise me ’.ἱ

5, 6. T. Give them up.

6, 7. H. The best advice: but how to spend my sleepless nights‘3

7-12. T. There are prescriptions for sleeplessness ; but if you must write poetry,
write the praises of Caesar.

1 2—16. H. Ι wish Ι could ; but it is not every one who is fitted to describe warlike
enterprises.

17, 18. Τ. Then describe his civil merits, as Lucilius described Scipio's.

18-20. H. When the time comes ; but it needs taet.

21—23. T. It is better than Satire. Your fictitious names only make it worse.
Everyone takes the hits to themselves.

24—34. Η. What can I do? Other people indulge their tastes. My taste is writing
verses, like Lucilius. They were his perpetual resource, his confidants. His
life is mirrored in them.

34-46. I follow in his train. Like my ancestors set on outpost duty at Venusia,
my weapons are for defence not for offence. Ι would fain live in peace, but if
any one assail me the town shall hear of it.

47-56. Instinct tells every living thing what is its weapon of self-defence.

57-60. The sum is ; whatever and wherever 1 am, write I must.

60-62. T. 1 sear then you will come to trouble with some of your great friends.

62-79. H. Nay, Laelius and Scipio were not offended when Lucilius laid bare
the vices of Metellus and Lupus. He attacked great and small impartially.
Laelius and Scipio were his friends and companions in their leisure. 1 do not
compare myself to his greatness, but no one can deny that Ι too have lived
with great rnen.

79-83. T. Be it so ; let me at least remind you of the law. It is a criminal offence
to write ‘ mala carmina ’ against anyone. .

[Horace brings the Satire to an end with the jest he has prepared]

83-85. H. Ay, but suppose they are ‘ bona‚' and Caesar thinks so : if the Satire

be deserved and the Satin'st's own hands clean ⁸?
