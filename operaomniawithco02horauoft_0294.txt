HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ad strepitum salias terrae gravis: et tamen urges
Iampridem non tacta ligonibus arva bovemque

Disiunctum curas et strictis frondibus exples;

Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,

Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato. 30
Nunc age, quid nostrum concentum dividat audi.

Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli,

Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,

Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni,

Cena brevis iuvat et prope rivum somnus in herba. 35
Nec lusisse pudet, sed non incidere ludum.

Non istic obliquo oculo mea commoda quisquam

Limat‚ non odio obscuro morsuque venenat3

26. terrae ι the dative after gravis.

et tamen. The‘se words are best
taken as a continuation os the supposed
complaints of the bailiff. He has none
of the pleasures osten found even in the
country, ‘ and yet ³ he has plenty of work.
This view gives more meaning to ‘ iam-
pridem non tacta ⁷ ; we need not look too
carefully for justificatory reasons—it is
part ofhis grumbling—‘ the ground seems
as if it had not been dug for years.’
Note also, possibly, with Schiitz that
a slight verba] play is carried on from
‘terrae gravis’ to ‘urges arva’: you
can't make the ground feel in one way
(cp. the feeling of the rustic taking out
his revenge in Od. 3. 18. 15 ‘ Gaudet in—
visam pepulisse ten-am Ter pede fossor'),
but you have to make it feel, at your
own cost in another. The verses have
also been taken (by Conington) as
though Horace were commenting on his
tasks (ironically) as a set—off to his dul-
neSS‚‘ and yet time need not hang heavy
on your hands.’ This does not lead as
well to the change in v. 31.

28. disitmcturn. The bailiff's la-
bours do not even cease when the ox is
unyoked; cp. the feeling of Od. 3. 6.

strictis frondibus: Virg. E. 9. 60
‘ agricolae stringunt frondes' ; cp. Epp.
1. 16. 9, 10.

29. pigro, ‘if you feel lazy.' The
rain which brings a holiday from other
farming work (Virg. G. 1. 259, cp. Sat.
2. 2. 119) brings you fresh toils. The
verse shows that Horace had some
meadow land reaching down to the

‘ Digentia.' For the metaphor of do—
eendus cp. A. P. 68.

31. nuno age z a Lucretian formula
of transition; see on Epp. 2. 1. 214.
This fresh start suits very well with the
view that we have been listening since
v. 19 to the bailiff’s views.

concentum dividat, prevents our
singing the same tune.

32. tenues: contrast ‘toga quamvis
crassa ⁷ Sat. 1. 3. 15.

nitidi capilli: Od. 2. 7. 7.

33. immunem, ‘ though empty—hand-
ed'3 Od. 4. 12. 23, and see on Od. 3.
23. 17.

Cinarae : Epp. 1. 7. 28 n. The con-
trast between the epithets in these two
passages and Od. 4. 1. 4 possibly imply
that she died in the interva13 see App.
1. to vol. 1 ‘ On the unknown names in
the Odes.’

34. liquidi, ⁴ well cleared'3 Od. 1. 1 1.
6, Sat. 2. 4. 55.

media de luce: sce on Sat. 2. 8. 3.

35. cena brevis: cp. ‘mensae bre-
vis⁷ A. P. 198.

36. lusisse ι for the sense of ‘ ludere '
cp. Epp. 2. 2. 56, 142, 214. The state-
ment is general; the shame is not in
having played, but in not putting a limit
to the play. For ‘ incidere' cp. Virg-
E. 9. 14 ‘ novas incidere lites?

37. istie: as ‘ istuc’ in v. 8.

38. limat, lit. ‘ files down.’ Cp. the
somewhat similar metaphor of ‘ de-
terere' Od. 1. 6. 12. Lachmann (on
Lucret. 3. 11) suggested that there is a
play on ‘limi oculi’ (see Sat. 2. 5. 75),
‘ sidelong glauces!
