HORATII EPISTULARUM

Et mala perrumpet furtim fastidia victrix. 25
Non qui Sidonio contendere callidus ostro

Nescit Aquinatem potantia vellera fucum

Certius accipiet damnum propiusque medullis,

Quam qui non poterit vero distinguere falsum.

Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae, 30

Mutatae quatient.
Invitus.

Si quid mirabere pones
Fuge magna: licet sub paupere tecto

Reges et regnum vita praecurrere amicos.

Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis

Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo 35
Imploravit opes hominis frenumque recepit;

Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste

Non equitem dorso, non frenum depulit ore.

2 5. fastidia. Cp. the use of ‘fasti-
diosus’ in Od. 3. 1. 37, 3. 29. 9; Epod.
17. 73 of disgusts and cravings that
are against nature. V had ‘vestigia,'
which must be a mistake. The Comm.
Cruq. interprets ‘fastidia' by ‘super-
biam.⁷ Some good MSS. have the
intermediate reading ‘fastigia‚’ which
being meaningless (though Torrentius
explains it of nature shut out from the
doors returning obstinately (⁴ mala ’)
over the ‘ roostops ¹) would be wrongly
corrected to ‘vestigia'

26 foll. The preference of town to
country has been brought round to seem
a hollow and illogical fancy, belied even
by those who gratify it. ‘ Yet‚' Horace
goes on, ‘in matters of life we need the
power of distinguishing shams from
realities more than we do in buying
purple stuffs.'

26. contendere callidus, ‘to com-
pare skilsully‚’ i.e. so as to distinguish
them. Cp. the use of ‘ callidus' Sat. 2.
3. 23 ‘as a connoisseur.’ We do not
know from other sources anything of
this manusacture of purple at Aqui-
num.

28. propius medullis: as Eur. Hipp.
255 πρὸς ἀκρὸν μυελὸν φρενῶν; of that
which touches us deeply.

30, 31. Two instances to show that
false judgments in matters of life are
followed with immediate and inevitable
penalties.

30. plus nimio: see note on Od. 1.
18. 15.

31. quatient. In the same sense as
Od. 3. 3. 4 ‘ mente quatit solida.’

si quid mirabere. The doctrine of
Epp. 1. 6. 1, ete.

pones=‘ depones’ Sat. 2. 3. 16.

32. fuge magna. The over-estima-
tion of ‘grandem' (cp. the thought in
Od. 3. 29. 9—16] is clearly connected by
Horace with the preference of town life
to country life.

33. reges, as types, conventionally‚ of
grand and happy living. ‘ Persarum
vigui rege beatior’ Od. 3. 9. 4, ‘ Regum
aequabat opes animis⁷ Virg. G. 4. 132.

34. cervus equum. This is the fable
told at length by Aristotle (Rhet. 2. 20)
as an illustration of the term λόγος or
‘sable.' It is attributed by him to the
poet Stesichorus, who is said to have
addressed it to the people of Himera in
order to dissuade them from putting
Phalaris into supreme power. It is
given with some variations by Phaedrus
4. 4, a boar being substituted sor the stag.

37. vietor violens. This is the
reading of all the MSS. except that E
reverses the order, ‘ violens victor.⁷
Bentley suspected a corruption, and
Haupt's ingenious suggestion, ‘ victo ri-
dens,q has seemed to several recent edi-
tors (incl. Munro and wilkins) suffi-
ciently probable to be adopted into the
text. Keller and Schiitz adhere to the
MSS. If we keep ‘violens ' it is not an
epithet of ‘victor’ but a separate pre-
dicative qualification. It answers to
‘improbus’ in the application of the
fable. The horse was ‘ violens,' ‘ force-
su1,' ‘ sor carrying things by force.' He
was successful in doing so, but found he
had sacrificed what was more valuable.
