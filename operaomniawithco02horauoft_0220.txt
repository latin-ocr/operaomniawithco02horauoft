208 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO

On the other hand, in Epist. 20, where Horace is apparently in-
tending to date the Book as well as his own life, he says that he
completed his forty-fourth December <the month of his birth) in
the year when Lollius was consul. This was in Β. C. 21. It is
a natural mode of dating if it means ‘last December '—-a less
natural one if another birthday has already passed. We are driven
therefore to choose between supposing that Agrippa achieved his
victory over the Cantabri or some parts of it in B. C. 20, in spite of
Dion Cassius' words, or that Horace's desire to link Lollius' name
with the conclusion of his book has led him to date it by the year
before the one last expired.

D‘tle and nature of tlze Epz‘stles.

Horace once uses the word ‘Epistula‚' in Epp. 2. 2. 22, possibly,
but not certainly, in the sense of a poetical epistle. In Epp. 2. 1.
250 he seems to include the Epistles of the First Book with the
Satires under the common title of ‘Sermones ¹.’ Otherwise we have
no direct evidence what title he intended them to bear. The
MSS. all call them ‘Epistulae,’ and the Scholiasts say that the title
was given to them by Horace himself.

They are ‘Epistulae' in varying senses. Some have not only the
form, but a definite purpose at the moment and such as finds
natural expression in a letter—enquiries about absent friends, as in
Ep. 33 an invitation, as in Ep. 53 the introduction of a friend, as
in Ep. 93 desire for information about a watering-place‚ as in Ep. 15.
To these we may add, as short and purely persona] in their tone,
Epp. 4, 8 and 12. It is hard again to draw a fixed line between
these and such Epistles as 7, 10 and 11, where, though a larger
and general subject is in view, the person addressed and the oc-
casion are never wholly lost. But the epistolary introduction and
conclusion tend by degrees to become merely an excuse for the
moralizing which intervenes, till, as in Epp. 1 and 6, the only relic
left of the letter is the vocative case which begins it, just as ‘Qui
fit, Maecenas?' or ‘Vel quia, Maecenasj begins a Satire. It is of
course possible to underrate the personal element which is really

¹ They are probably also included is said that Augustus ‘post Sermones
in the title ‘ Sermones ' in the Suetonian lectos ’ complained that none was ad-
life of Horace tvol. i. p. xxix), where it dressed to him.
