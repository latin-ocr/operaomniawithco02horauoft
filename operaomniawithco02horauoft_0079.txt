LIB. I.

Messius ‘Accipio‚' caput et movet.

SAT. 5.

‘O‚ tua cornu

Ni foret exsecto frons‚' inquit, ‘quid faceres, cum

Sic mutilus miniteris?'

At illi foeda cicatrix

60

Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.

Campanum in morbum, in faciem permulta iocatus,
Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat:

Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis.

Multa Cicirrhus ad haec:

Ex voto Laribus, quaerebat3
Nihilo deterius dominae ius esse.
Denique cur unquam fugisset,

Donasset iamne catenam

scriba quod esset,
Rogabat
cui satis una

Farris libra foret, gracili sic tamque pusillo.
Prorsus iucunde cenam producimus illam. 70

58. accipio. Ter. Andr. 5. 4. 48
‘ Ch. Dos, Pamphile, est decem talenta.
Pam. Accipio‚‘ ‘ Ι am satisfied.’ ‘Be it
so.' Mr. Yonge compares Soph. El.
668 ἐδεξάμην τὸ ῥηθέν.

movet, i.e. as acting the part.

cornu ni foret exsecto, in reference
probably to the supposed ‘unicoru,‘
which Pliny N. H. 8. 21 describes as
‘asperrima fera reliquo corpore equo
similis.’

60. at opposes the true explanation
to the humorous one given by Sar-
mentus. Cp. Epp. 1. 2. 42.

61. setosam : the picture of his
bristly hairs low on the forehead helps
the resemblance to the wild horse.

62. campanum morbum.
Scholiasts were puzzled. The Comm.
Cruq. connects it with the verse before,
explaining it of warts or excrescences
which grew on the sorehead‚ and which
when removed would leave a sear.
Heindorf's note suggests its probable
connection with the jest which follows,
through the name given (by Aristotle
and Galen) to a similar complaint
σατυρίασις. Compare the connection in
Epp. 2. 2. 125 of the Satyr and the
Cyclops—dame, and notice that Horace
kept in mind the etymological connec-
tion of ‘tragicus ’ with τράγος, ‘ a goat‚'
A. P. 220.

63. pastorem Cyclopa, the accu-
sative as in Epp. 2. 2. 125. For the
nature of these dances see Diet. Ant.
s. v. ‘ Pantomimus.'

64. larva, here ot the mask with white

The

paint and gaping mouth (‘personae
pallentis hiatus⁷)‚ which, according to
Juvenal (3. 175³, frightened children
from a rustic stage.

65. A satirical reference to the prac-
lice of dedicating to some god imple-
ments that their owner has done with
(as the gladiator in Epp. Ι. 1. 4, and the
lover in Od. 3. 26. 3) ; perhaps specially‚
as the Scholiasts say, to the custom
among freeborn youths on attaining
manhood of consecrating to the Lares
their ‘bulla.' Martial has a similar
gibe (possibly with reference to this
passage), on a man who from slavery
had become an ‘eques’: 3. 29 ‘Has
cum gemina compede dedicat catenaS,
Saturne, tibi Zoilus annulos priores.’
The ‘ catenae' would imply that he had
run away and been sentenced to the
‘ ergastulum ' to work in chains.

67. nihilo, a disffll„ as alwaysls
in Lucret.; see Munro on Lucret. 1.

ὃὸ. una farris libra. Heindorf points
out, from Aul. Gell. 20. 1, that this
was by the Twelve Tables the minimum
allowance to be made to a debtor iu
prison. Cato, De R. R. 56, fixes the
usual allowanee of slaves in the country
at from four to five modii a month. This
would give as the daily portion about
three times what is mentioned here.
Slaves it would seem from this ran
away on account of bad fare.

70. producimus, so the great ma-
jority of MSS. against ‘produximus’
Orelli's argument that the present would
