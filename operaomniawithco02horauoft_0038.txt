HORATII SATIRARUM

Pauperiem metuas minus, et finire laborem

Incipias, parto quod avebas, ne facias quod

Ummidius quidam: non longa est fabula: dives 95
Ut metiretur numm053 ita sordidus ut se

Non unquam servo melius vestiret3 adusque

Supremum tempus, ne se penuria victus

Opprimeret metuebat.

At hunc liberta securi
Divisit medium, fortissima Tyndaridarum.

‘Quid mi igitur suades? ut vivam Naevius aut sic

> Ut Nomentanus?’

the plea has been exposed. He adds
a picture of the end of the miser's friend-
less life, murdered by his venal atten-
(lant-paiamour, not without some kind
os approbation from the world.

finis quaerendi: the expression is
from Lucilius, fragm. incert. 1. 6 ‘ Virtus
quaerendae rei finem scire modum-
que.

plus answers to ‘minus‚’ ‘ since you
have more [than you had] sear penury
less [than you did].’

94. ne facias quod, the colourless
use of ‘ sacere‚' standing, as our ‘to d0,‘
sor some more definite verb; see on V.
643 ‘lest that befall you which befell
Ummidius?

95. bentley wished to substitute ‘qui
tarn' sor quidam against the MSS„
and Palmer follows him.

96. ut> metiretur, to the point of
estimating his money by weight instead
of by counting———a proverbial expression.
Cf. Xen. Hellenic. g. 2. ‘³7 τὸν λε’γύ-
μενον μεδίμνῳ ἀπομετρήσασθαι τὸ παρὰ
τοῦ πατρὸς ἀργύριονε ‘dives ut metire-
tur' would be Horatian, see Sat. 2. 7.
10: but here ‘ita' is probably supplied
from the second clause.

100. divisit, medium. Virg. Aen. 9.
750 ‘ Et mediam ferro gemina inter tem-
pora frontem Dividit?

fortissima Tyndaridarum, as Bent—
ley explains it, lit. · bravest ofthe children
of 'Tyndarus' ‹with Bentley the ‘ Tyn-
daridarum' is a masc. form)—i. e. a
second Clytemnestra—wvmmls ἀνδρό-
βουλον κέαρ. The epithet ‘foxtissirna'
therefore properly belongs to Clytem-
nestra, not to her imitator, but the re—
ference to heroic precedent is meant to
make his sate sornewhat ridiculous, as
though the world would smile at it and

Pergis pugnantia secum

think it served him right rather than
be indignant at it. lt has been sug-
gested that there may have been a
further appropriateness in the actual
name of the freedwoman <for the story
is clearly a real one)-a ‘ Clytemnestra ’
or ⁴ Tyndaris.’

101. The miser's last plen, ‘What!
you wish me to be a spendthrist.'

vivam NaeviUS, ‘sie ut' is to be
borrowed from the following clause.
See on v. 96, and cp. the similar omis-
sion of ‘ut' in the second clause in
Epod. 1. 34. Naevius (or Nevius) is
the reading of the MSS. It was altered
to Maenius first by Glareanus, with
next to no external grounds. in order to
identify the representative os prodigality
here with the Maenius of Sat. 1. 3. 21
and Epp. 1. 15. 26, and so Orelli and
Dillr. give it.

102. Nomentanus Cp. Sat. 1. 8.
11, 2. 1. 22, 2. 3. 175, 224, 2. 8. 23, 25,
60. The Scholiasts call him Cassius
Nomentanus, ‘adeo sine respectu cal-
culonum suorum prodigus ut septuagies
gulae ac libidini impenderit,' and make
him belong to llorace's generation,
giving a story that Sallust the historian
hired his eook for 100‚000 sesterces a
year. The sorrn osAcron's note however
betrays its little value, ‘ aliter, Nomen-
tanus aut nomen proprium est aut gen-
tile de Nomentana civitate.' In reality
the name is from Lucilius (fragm. 2. 4
and 5). See Introd. to Satires, p.
12.

pergis, ‘you proceed to set together
forehead to forehead things that fight
one another‚' i.e. to set off against
one another, as if there was no neutral
third alternative, contradictory oppo-
sites.
