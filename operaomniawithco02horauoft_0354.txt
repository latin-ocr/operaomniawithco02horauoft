338 HORATII EPISTULARUM

139-155. Poetry began with us in the rough improvisations of Fescennine verse,
so rough that the law had to step in.

156-160. Then came Greek influence, sostening and refining, but the old rusticity
did not go at once, if it has gone now.

161-164. It was late, aster the Punic wars, when Roman writers first began to know,
and then to try to imitate, Greek tragedy and comedy.

165—167. They were only too well satisfied with themselves. Their tragedy was
good enough in spirit, but too hasty.

168—176. Comedy was thought easier, but the failure is on this account the more
palpable. Look at Plautus with his coarsely drawn characters and slip-shod
style. That came from writing sor money.

177-181. Another great difficulty of the dramatic poet is his dependence on his
audienee.

182—207. And the audience amongst us, or the most numerous and noisy part of it,
cares for the excitement of spectacles more than for real drama.

208-213. Do not think that I am undervaluing the dramatic art. It is wonderful.

214—218. But give a share of your patronage to other poets also.

219—228. I know it is osten our own fault that you do not. We are devoid
of tact, we are impatient of criticism, we are too exacting in our de-
mands.

229—2 31. Still it is worth while to see what sort of poets are set to celebrate your
great deeds.

232-244. Alexander, though he was particular as to the painters and sculptors
who took his likeness, pald a miserable poetaster for singing of his ex-
ploits.

245-2 50. You have been wiser in ehoosing Virgil and Varius, and you know what
the poet can do to immortalize greatness.

250—270. Ι would sing your deeds myself, is Ι could. But Ι am afraid of bringing
you and myself too into contempt.

Horace, taking his pen at the bidding of Augustus, in order to link the Em-
peror’s name with one of his ‘ Sermones‚’ chooses with great tact, as the subject
of his Epistle, an apology for the poetry of the Augustan age, for poetry as he,
V irgil, and Varius, understood it.

The first eighty-nine lines are occupied in directly attacking the school which
decried all contemporary poets in its admiration, real or professed, sor the ancientS.
This leads him in v. 90 to institute a comparison between the history of poetry
in Greece and Rome, which is to explain why Roman poetry is only now being
brought to perfection. It is the same explanation as that which is given in the
Ars Poetica: ‘ Grais ingenium . . . dedit Musa? Peace was necessary in either
case for the development of literature, but when once that external condition
was satisfied, there followed a spontaneous burst of artistic life in a thousand
forms. The nature was artistic, and only circumstances restrained it. In Rome,
on the contrary, all the original tendencies were prudential and utilitarian. When
poetry came, as it had come now, it carne by a sudden reaction, and to people not
prepared for it. Then follows, 118 f., a playful passage, with its serious side, in
which he pleads even for this new development of uninstructed verse writing.
⁴ It is better than many things, better than the sordid money-getting to which
Romans were inclined. lt has its use. Poetry is worth something in edueation
and in religion, as you recognized, when you set me to write an ode for the secular
games' Then he sketches (139 s.) the actual course of Latin poetry, its rustic
origin, with the coarscness and personal [one which attached to it, the introduction
