HORATII ARS POETICA.

Concubitu prohibere vago, dare iura maritis,
Oppida moliri, leges incidere ligno.

Sic honor et nomen divinis vatibus atque
Post hos insignis Homerus

Carminibus venit.

400

Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia bella
Versibus exacuit; dictae per carmina sortes;
Et vitae monstrata via est3 et gratia regum

Pieriis temptata modis; ludusque repertus

405

Et longorum operum finis: ne forte pudori

Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo.
Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte
Quaesitum est: ego nec studium sine divite vena

Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium5 alterius sic

410

Altera poscit opem res et coniurat amice.
Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam
Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit,
Abstinuit Venere et vino: qui Pythia cantat

Tibicen, didicit prius extimuitque magistrum.

398. maritis, ‘ married persons.’

399. incidere ligno, i. e. to take the
first rude steps towards fixedness of law.
For the Athenian wooden tables of
laws see Lidd. and Scott‚ s. vv. κύρβεις,
ἄξονες.

400. divinis: pred. ‘as divine.'

401. insignis, with post hos The
point is that the poetry of Homer, who
ranks only after the mythic semi-divine
poets, was also of practica] use.

402. Tyrtaeus, who according to the
story was sent from Athens to aid
the Spartans in the second Messenian
wars.

404. vitae monstrata via est:
he speaks of didactie poetry as of
Hesiod‚ gnomic poetry as of Solon,
Theognis, etc.

gratia regum ε as Pindar courted the
favour of Hiero, Thero, etc.

405. ludus . . . operum finis, prob-
ably with special reference to the drama 3
cp.Epp.2.1.139f.

406. ne sorte: probably not an im-
perative clause but a final, giving the
motive of the preceding recital of the
beneficent part played by poetry. ‘All
this is to prevent your ever being
ashamed,' etc. See on v. 176.

408-415. Horace poses the old ques—

4¹5

tion of the poet ‘ nascitur’ or ‘ fit? ’ and
solves it in the usual way, that he needs
both natural gifts and the training of
art; but as the illustrations show the
point to be insisted on is the second.
lt was the one which he felt to be most
overlooked by his countrymen.

409. vena: see on Od. 2. 18. 10. ν

410. prosit. This is the reading of
all the best MSS. against ‘ possit,' which
was brought into the text by Bentley.
The two words are often confused in
MSS. (ep. Od. 1. 26. 10, where also
Bentl. reads ‘ possunt ²). ‘Possit' is,
as he says, rather the more pointed.

412 f. Compare St. Paul, 1 Cor. 9.
24 f.

413. puer, ‘ while still a boy.’ One
who aims at success in athletic contests
begins his training in early life.

414. Pythia cantat. This is variously
taken (Ι) after the construction of ‘ coro-
nari Olympia ' Epp. Ι. 1. 50, of one who
takes part in the contest in flute-playing
at the P vthian games; (2) of the Πυ-
θαύλης = ‘ τὰ Πύθια αὐλῶν (Liddell and
Scott, s. v.) or player chosen to play the
piece in honour of Apollo’s victory over
the Python. This last is the Scholiast's
explanation.
