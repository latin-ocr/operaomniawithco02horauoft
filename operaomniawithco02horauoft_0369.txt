LIB. ΙΙ.

Et placuit sibi, natura sublimis et acer3

Nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet,
Sed turpem putat inscite metuitque lituram.
Creditur, ex medio quia res arcessit, habere
Sudoris minimum, sed habet comoedia tanto

Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus.

EPIST. Ι. 353

Aspice, Plautus 170

Quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi,
Ut patris attenti, lenonis ut insidiosi;
Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis,

165. et placuit sibi. Horace rallies
Roman poets on their sels-complacency
and ignorance of the exacting claims of
art.

sublimis. With reference to the
meanings os μετέωρος <see on Od. 1. 15.
31), ‘lifted off the ground' or ‘with
head in air '; literally, as in A. P. 457
of the poet who walks into a pit—fall, or
metaphorically, from eagerness, as here,
and in A. P. 165 of the young man
‘ sublimis cupidusque.' There is a flavour
of caricature in the word.

166. spirat tragicum satis. We
are meant to feel some bathos in the
minimizing adverb ‘satis' aster ‘spirat
tragicum,' ‘ has the true tragie breath’
or inspiration. See on Od. 2. 16. 38.

feliciter audet, ‘is happy in his
ventures ³—an0ther phrase to which the
connection gives a suspicion of irony.
XYas Quintilian remembering the words
when twithout any irony) he charac-
terizes Horace as ⁴ variis figuris et verbis
felicissime audax? '

167. inscite, ἀπαιδεύτως. V had
‘inscriptis’ (Dillr. accepts it), but the
Scholiasts interpret ‘turpem putat in-
scite ’ by ‘ stulte e1·ubescit.⁷

lituram: A. P. 293, and ep. Sat. 1.

168 foll. The comic writers are still
more apt to be lazy, thinking their sub-
ject excuses the1n; but the fact that the
subject is within the experience of all
makes us less tolerant of carelessness.

168. ex medio: as A. P. 243 *de
medio ’ ; ‘ from common ground ' here =
‘from daily life’; cp. ‘in medio posi-
torum,' Epp. 1. 12. 7n.

arcessit. V had ‘accessit‚’ found
also in E, but it arose perhaps from
the variations between ‘arcessit ' and ‘ ac-
cersit.’ Aer. read ‘ aecersit.‘

171. quo paeto.

Porph. explains

‘ quarn indecenter,' and so many editors 3
but Schiitz seems right in saying that
abuse, all round, of Plautus does not
suit the parallel case of tragedy vv.
166, 167. There the judgment was
that the Roman writers had spirit and
force but lacked industry. ‘It was
thought} Horace has said, ‘ that the re-
quirements of comedy were easier, but
the truth is that sailure there is more
fatal because every one can perceive it.’
‘ Judge for yourselves ’ z-he goes on—
‘look at Plautus; see how he draws his
favourite characters ; how he catches the
very spirit of droll sarcc in his greedy
parasites—yet how hasty and slipshod
his style is.’ I arn taking for granted
the second of the two interpretations of
‘quantus sit Dossennus⁷ discussed below.
If the first were adopted we might still
give a colourless meaning to ‘quo pacto‚'
etc., the mingled praise and blame of
‘quantus,' ‘quam non adstricto' would
be meant to be carried back in thought
upon the case of Plautus from that of
Dossennus.

172. attenti, ‘ careful '; with the
special meaning of ‘close with his
money’: Sat. 2. 6. 82, Epp. 1. 7. 91.

173. quantus sit Dossennus. This
verse has caused much difficulty. The
traditional explanation is osa writer of
‘Atellanae’ of the name of Dossennus.
‘ How great Dossennus is in his greedy
parasites.’ This was clearly intended
by Porph. and the Comm. Cruq. gives
distinetly ‘Dossennus Atellanarum scrip-
tor,' and the view is still supported by
Schiitz as it was by Orelli. The only
extraneous references to such a writer
that can be quoted are (1) words os
