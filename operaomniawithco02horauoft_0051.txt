SAT. 3.

39

Non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus, at ingenium ingens

Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.

Denique te ipsum

Concute num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim 35
Natura, aut etiam consuetudo mala3 namque

Neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris.

Illuc praevertamur, amatorem quod amicae

Turpia decipiunt caecum vitia, aut etiam ipsa haec
Delectant, veluti Balbinum polypus Hagnae. 40
Vellem in amicitia sic erraremus; et isti

Errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.

At pater ut gnati sic nos debemus amici

Si quod sit vitium non fastidire: strabonem

Appellat paetum pater, et pullum male parvus 45
Si cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim

35. concute, ‘ shake‚’ as a dress, to
see if anything is concealed in it. Cp.
for the same metaph, though with a
different purpose, Virg. Aen. 7. 338 ‘ se-
cundum concute pectus.' ‘ Excutere ' is
more common in this sense.

37. filix. Virg. G. 2. 189 ‘filicem
curvis invisam pascit aratris.’

38. illuc praevertamus· quod, ‘let
us take refuge in the thought that.’

39. decipiunt: λανθάνουσι.

40. Balbinum. The Scholiast's note
is ‘ Luciliana urbanitate usus iu transitu
amaritudinem aspergit‚’ but there is no
tradition, or conjecture of value, as to
the personality of the persons mentioned.
The name has been thought to be coined
from ‘balbus‚' used of the baby—talk
of lovers; see below v. 47. Cp. Sat.
2. 3. 274; see Prof. Palmer there.

polypus. Horace here and in Epod.
12 lengthens the first syllable, following
therein Lucilius (29. 114). It is to
be noticed that the word occurs in
Greek literature usually in the form
πουλύπους ; see Liddell and Scott‚ s. v.

Hagnae. The MSS. are divided
between this reading and ⁴ Agnae‚⁷ but
Bentley showed that ‘ Hagna ' is the form
found in inscriptions. It is the Greek
ἁγνή. ‘ Libertinam fuisse reete colligas’
Bentley.

42. virtus. See on Od. 2. 2. 19, the
personified judgment of the virtuous
man.
beffssicgtjaffissgtstgrt ‘lgiiztmlgisss'motr ‘castil'ngg
Virg. G. 4. 208, 241) : the form

‘vellem erraremus' implies that it is a
hopeless wish. If we cannot reach the
complete blindness of a lover we may
the partiality of a father. There is
rather more MS. authority (including B)
for ‘ ac,' but the transition is harsh.

gnati: understand ‘siquod sit vitium
non fastidit?

44. strabonem . . . paetum: two
terms used to express different degrees
of squinting: ‘paetus' expressing the
lighter and one which was thought
almost a beauty, so much so that it was
attributed to Venus. Cic. de N. D. 1.
29. 80 ‘Ecquos (deos) si non tam stra-
bones at paetulos arbitramur’? Varr.
quoted by Priscian, p. 684 ⁴ de Venere
paeta strabam facit.⁷

44—48. With these lines should be
compared Ovid's advice to the lover to
make the best of his mistress' defects:
‘ Nominibus mollire licet mala. Fusea
vocetur Nigrior Illyrica cui pice san-
guis erit: Si straba sit, Veneri similis:
si rava, Minervae: Sit gracilis, macie
quae male viva sua est. Dic habilem,
quaeeunque brevis‚’ etc. A. A. 2. 657
foll. Both are imitations of Lucr. 4.
1160 foll.

45. pullum, ‘a chicken.' It is a
diminutive from the same root as ⁴ puer.’
It is found as a cognomen. L. Junius
Pullus was consul in B. C. 250, and there
is a Q. Numitorius Pullus mentioned in
Cic. de Inv. 2. 34, de Fin. 5. 22. 62.

male parvus, ‘ small to a fault ; ' sor
the use of ‘ male ' with an adj. see on Od.
1. 17. 25 and Sat. 1. 4. 66.
