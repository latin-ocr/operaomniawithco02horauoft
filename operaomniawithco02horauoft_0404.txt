388 HORATII ARS POETICA.

153—178. The first point an audience cares sor is a real discrimination of the
characteristics of human nature in each of the stages of life. These must be
well studied.

179-188. They must then be set out in action, not in narrative3 but this not
carried to the extent of producing revolting or marvellous scenes on the
stage.

189-192. Five acts, no more and no less. A ‘deus ex machina ' only when the
occasion really requires it. Three characters only on the stage at once.

193—201. On the other hand the Chorus must be treated as an integral part of the
drama. Its business is to help on the action, and specially to take the moral
and religious side in it.

zoa—219. The lyrical part of the drama was simpler in old days. As audiences
have become more mixed the music became more elaborate, the diction more
suited, the tone more oracular.

τεο-239. (In the same way) the desire to interest a miscellaneous audience led
to adding the Satyric drama to tragedy. But moderatiori and tact are
necessary. Tragic characters must not be lowered in the following Satyric
drama. Neither need they rant. Tragedy has its proper dig1⁷=ity5 so has
the Satyric drama itself. It is not tragedy‚ but neither is it comedy.

240-243. Do not look for an original story, only sor freshness of treatment.

244—250. The chorus of satyrs must keep from low and coarse language: think
of the better not of the worse part of your audience.

251—269. flletre. Avoid the great fault of the older Roman tragedians, heavy
and spondaic verses. Roman poets have been demoralized by inartistic
audiences. Neither presume on this nor be slavishly afraid of censure, but
steep yourself in Greek models.

270-274. No doubt your ancestors put up with and praised Plautus for his
rhythms as well as his wit ; but they were too indulgent in both points. We
should know the rules of art better.

275-284. The Greeks are the masters: they invented the drama, and perfected it.
tragedy and even comedy, from the too free criticism of the older type to the
more sober and toothless new comedy of manners

285—294. But our countrymen have imitated every phase, and have struck out lines
of their own both in tragedy and comedy. Indeed Rome would rival Greece
in literature as in arms were it not for our laziness in perfecting our work.

295—301. This laziness is reduced to a theory. Men undervalue art in comparison
with the native gift, and look on that as the antithesis of common sense.

301-308. As Ι cannot follow them, 1 have given up writing poetry myself, but
1 arn trying to teach others to write it, as a whetstone makes knives cut
though it cannot cut itself.

309-318. Good writing begins in good thinking. Read Plato, understand human
life, draw direct from that, and then your characters will speak like living
beings.

319·332. Roman audiences give even a disproportionate value to good sentiments
and morals, and too little to poetic beauty. This is the result of our
vulgarizing practica] education.

333-346. There are in truth two aims in poetry, instruction and pleasure. When
you would teach remember the importance of brevity; when you would please
remember the importance of verisimilitude. But if you would gratify all

your audience you must combine both aims. This is the true classical
poetry that lives.
