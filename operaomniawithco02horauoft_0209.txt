SATIRE VIII.

AN UPsTART’s SUPPER-PARTY.

A SKETCH of a supper given to Maecenas by a man of wealth without taste
or breeding. Horace puts the description of it into the mouth of Fundanius,
the comic poet, of whom he speaks with admiration in Sat. 1. 10. 40: but it
represents no doubt, many entertaimnents at which he had himself suffered and
been amused.

Three men of letters have been invited as appropriate guests to meet Maecenas,
Fundanius himself, Viscus (see on v. 20), andearius. The rest of the company
consists of the chief guest with two ‘ umbrae ’ (vv. 21, 22) whom he has brought,
and two ‘scurrae‚’ ‘ Nomentanus,' and ‘ Porcius,’ who are habitual frequenters
of the host's table.

The host is called Nasidienus Rufus (vv. Ι, 75, 84, and 58)—doubtless a
fictitious name. A conjecture of Lambinus identifies the person so disguised
with Salvidienus Rufus, who had been advanced by Augustus ‘ex infima
fortuna' (Suet. Aug. 66), and who was put to death by him for conspiracy
against his interests in Β. C. 40. In that case the Satire would be written some
years after his death. Nasidienus was itself a Roman name and occurs in Martia]

What is satirized is the vulgarity of the man. He has literary men to meet
Maecenas, but he can talk of nothing but the dishes. He is sull of the gas-
