HORATII ARS POETICA.

Interpres, nec desilies imitator in arctum

Unde pedem proferre pudor vetet aut operis lex.

135

Nec sic incipies ut scriptor cyclicus olim:
‘ Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.’
Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu?
Parturient monteS, nascetur ridiculus mus.

Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte:

‘Dic mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Troiae
Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes.’

Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem
Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin.

134. imitator, ‘when you imitate’;
see on ‘scriptor' in v. 120.

desilies in arctum, i. e. voluntarily
put yourselfinto adifficulty. The figure
is from the sable of the goat who was
persuaded by the {ox to leap down into
the well, though Horace is concerned
only with the goat's part in the story.

135. operis leit, i.e. the sels-imposed
conditions os your task.

136. scriptor cyclicus, i. e. one of
the lesser poets whose epiCS, as dealing
with the same cycle of legends, were
arranged by the Alexandrine critics by
the side of the Homerie poemS. The
particular poet of whom Horace speaks
is unknown. It seems possible that
he is inventing a typical opening of
such a poem. olim lends itself not
improperly to a fictitious instance.

137. As compared with the opening
of the Odyssey this line is more pre-
tentious both in its style cantabo, no-
bile (Homer leaves you to find out
afterwards that the subject is a striking
one), and (which is probably more in
Horace’s mind) in the breadth of the
subject which it announces. Homer is
content with a passage srom the life of
his hero, though that passage will turn
out to have plenty of incident. The
Cyclic writer promises both a biography
and a history. It is the same point as
that touched in Aristotle’s remark, Poet.
27, that ¹ of the Iliad and of the Odyssey
severally a single tragedy only or two
at most could be made, whereas of the
“Cypria'' ta poem os the Cyclus), or
of the “Lesser Iliad,'' more than eight
might be made?

138. promissor: see above v. 14.

145

139. parturient: a Greek proverb,
preserved by Athenaeus 14. 6 ὤδινεν
ὄρος, Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο, τὸ δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν.
It stands as a fable in Phaedr. 4. 22.
All good MSS. have the future. Bentley
altered it to ‘parturiunt‚’ on the autho-
rity chiefly of a quotation in Jerome,
and most editors have followed him.
K. and H. keep the text of the MSS„
and Schiitz points out that it rightly
follows the tense of ‘ incipies? ‘ If you
do, it will be a case of mountains in
labour,⁷ etc.

ridiculus mus. Quintilian (8. 3. 19)
cites this as an imitation of Virgil’s
‘ exiguus mus’ Georg. 1. 181, pointing
out how in each case everything com-
bines, the epithet, the singular number,
and the unusual monosyllabic ending
of the verse, to give the appropriate idea
of smallness.

140. molitur, of effort.

141, 142. For another paraphrase of
the beginning of the Odyssey see Epp.
1. 2. 19-22.

141. tempora: Od. 1. 21. 11 ‘Tro-
iana tempora.’

144. speciosa miracula, ‘things
striking and marvellous.' Aristotle says,
Poet. 24. 8, that even tragedy should
contain τὸ θαυμαστόν. Epic poetry is
allowed also τὸ ἄλο-γον, that is, com-
binations which to the prosaic reason are
impossible. Horace is speaking here
of the scope for interest and imagination
which Homer finds within his limited
and modestly introduced subject.

145. Antiphaten, king of the Laes-
trygones‚ Odyss. 10. 100 s.

Scyllam, Charybdin: Odyss. 1 2. 8 1 f.

cyclope: Odyss. 9. 187 f.
