In media iussit Libya, quia tardius irent

Propter onus segnes.

Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.
Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum,

Nec studio citharae nec Musae deditus ulli3

Si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela
Aversus mercaturis; delirus et amens

Undique dicatur merito.

Qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti

Compositis, metuensque velut contingere sacrum?

Si quis ad ingentem frumenti semper acervum
Porrectus vigilet cum longo fuste, neque illinc
Audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,
Ac potius foliis parcus vescatur amaris;

Si positis intus Chii veterisque Falerni

i. e. in a journey to or from Cyrene.
‘Graecus'z‘in the Greek story‚’ but
perhaps it is dramatic and depreciatory‚
as though Cyrenaicism (and Epicurean-
ism) were Greek, Stoicism the Roman
school. Stertinius is hitting hard the
founder of the school of thought most
opposed to his own.

103. It is of no use to set up Staberius
against Aristippus or Aristippus against
Staberius. Each is open to criticism
in turn. You have only substituted one
question for another. Take examples
from some other art; it will be seen
at once that a man who accumulates
implements and then does not use them
is thought a madman.

104. emat . . . emptaS, ‘buy‚ and
after bnying pile them on a heap.' For
the effect of the repetition Orelli quotes
Virg. Aen. 6. 420 ‘ offam Obiicit ;
ille . . . Corripit obiectam‚’ Ov. Met.
9. 74 ‘(Hydram) domni domitamque
peregi.’

105. neo Musae. If he were fond
of music at all he might have some con-
ceivable use sor the instrumentS, even if
he could not play them himself.

106. formas, ‘ a shoemaker’s last?

non sutor, ⁴ one who is not a
cobbler.’

108. undique, ‘on all hands,' i.e.
by every one ; see on Od. 1. 7. 7.

qui, ‘how‚’ as Sat. 1. 1. 1.

1 10. compositis, ‘ aster he has stored
them '3 ‘ componere opes ' Virg. Aen. 8.
317.

velut. To complete the sentence
‘ contingere ' must be understood before
it, ‘ fearing to touch them as to touch
what is sacre(l’; cp. Sat. Ι. 1. 71 ‘tam—
quam parcere sacris Coge1·is‚’ a parallel
for the position of ‘ velut ⁷ as well as for
the thought.

111. acervum. The picture is (as
Ritter points out) of corn just thrashed
out on the ‘area,’ which its owner
watches himself till it is sold or carried
home.

113. esuriens dominus,
hungry and the master of it.'

contingere. Repeated from v. 110
in order to point the similitude.

114. parcus, absol. ‘ as a miser.²

115. Chii . . . Falerni, ⁴ of the best
Greek and Italian wines '; cp. Sat. 1. 10.
2 .

41 17. acetum, ‘ wine turned sour.'
age, si. So Cic. Phil. 5. 11. 27 όΑςε,
si paruerit,’ ⁴ Nay, if he disobey,⁷ etc.
stramentis, ‘ a straw bedf
unde-Octoginta. For the division
between the two verses cp. Epp. 2. 2.
93 ‘ circum-Spectemus,’ A. P. 424
⁶ inter-Noscere‚' Porph. (on Epp. 2. 2.
93) speaks of it as a. licence copied from
