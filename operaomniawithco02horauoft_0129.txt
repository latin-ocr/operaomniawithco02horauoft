LIB. II.

SAT. 1.

Vitalis metuo, et maiorum ne quis amicus

Frigore te feriat.'

Quid, cum est Lucilius ausus

Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,
Detrahere et pellem, nitidus qua quisque per ora

Cederet, introrsum turpis, num Laelius aut qui (¹5
Duxit ab oppressa meritum Karthagine nomen,

Ingenio offensi aut laeso doluere Metello

Famosisque Lupo cooperto versibus?

color: Epp. 1. 17. 23.

puer, as Horace himself addresses
Trebatius (v. 12) as ‘ pater. '

ut sis vitalis. For the contrasted
constr. ‘metuo ut. .ne’ cp ‚Sar 1.
4. 3²· ‘Vitalis'asin Sat. 2. 7. 4 ‘with
much life in you,’ ‘likely to live.’
There is a reference in Trebatiusgboth
(as Schiitz notices) to the alternative
named by Horace in v. 58, and also
rerbally to ‘vitae' in v. 60. Horace
has also in mind probably the words
of Thetis to Achilles (Hom. 11. 18. 95)
ὠκύμορος δή μοι τέκος ἔσσεαι οἷ’ ἀγορεύεις.
The gist of the answer is that Horace
cannot afford this freedom. He lives
on the breath of great patrons. This
gives him the opportunity of vindicating
the character of his friendship. It leaves
him as free as the friendship of Laelius
and Africanus left Lucilius.

61. maiorum, in the sense of ‘the
great,' ‘those greater than yourselveS‚'
as in Epp. 1. 17. 2. ‘ Maiorum quis ami-
cus' may be compared with ‘ quae vir—
ginum barbara ’ in Od. 2. 29. 5

62. frigore, in the first place (as
is seen in Persius' imitation 1. 108 ‘ne
maiorum tibi forte Limina frigescant ’)
of the ‘coldness‚' i.e. indifference, of
offended friends; but there is also with
‘feriat' the metaphorical sense of
VVolsey's* ⁴ a frost, a killing frost.’

63. primus, as ‘inventor,’ Sat. 1.
10 48

64. detrahere pellem, as Epp. 1.
16. 45 ‘Introrsum turpem, speciosum
pelle decoras As the use of the word

‘pellis‘ (i.e. the skin of a beast) shows,
there is a reference more or less con-
scious to a fabIe, such as the ass and
the lion's skin‚ the fox and the sheep's

Atqui

skin ; see on Sat. 1. 6. 22.

65. eederet=‘incederet‚' an archaic
usage3 ‘incedere per ora,⁷ ‘to march
before men’s eyes,' Sall. Jug. 31.

Laelius. C. Laelius Sapiens (cp.
v. 72), the son of the friend of Africanus
maior, the interlocutor in Cicero's de
Amicitia.

qui duxit. For this mode of desig-
nating Scipio Africanus minor see on
Od. 4. 8. 13—20.

67. ingenio offensi, se. ‘sunt'?'
‘did they find matter of ofsence in his
wit'?

Metello. Q. Caecilius Metellus Mace-
donicus, a political opponent of Scipio.

68. famosis, ‘ scandalous,⁷ as in
Epp. Ι. 19. 31 ‘sanioso carmine‘ of
Archilochus' lampeons.

Lupo. The name occurs in several
fragments of Lucilius, esp. in a passage
quoted iu Cic. de Nat. D. Ι. 23. 64 ‘ Tu—
bulus si Lucius unquam Si Lupus aut
Carbo Neptuni filius, ut ait Lucilius, pu—
tasset esse deos, tam periurus aut tam
impurus fuisset'? The Scholiasts ex-
plain the reference of P. Rutilius Lupus,
cos. B.C. 90, but Servius on Virg. A.
10. 104 says that Lucilius in the first
book of his Satires had represented the
gods in council as discussing the death
of Lupus, and Lucilius himself accord-
ing to the Chron. Euseb. died in ΒΕ.
103. Torrentius suggested that the
person intended is L. Cornelius Len-
tulus Lupus who was cos. in B. C. 157,
and though subsequently convicted‘ re-
petundarum’ was Censor in a later year

cooperto, ‘pelted,’ ‘smotheiedf

atqui, ‘and yet‘ it was not merely
one or two great offenders that fell under
the lash.

*The metaphor and its application is more fully worked out in Shakespeare' s Sonnet 25¹ ν
‘Great prince’s favourites their fair leaves spread
But as a marigold at the sun 's eye

For at a frown they in their glory die.’
