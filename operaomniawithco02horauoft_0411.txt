Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos,

Prima cadunt: ita verborum vetus interit aetas,
Et iuvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque.
Debemur morti nos nostraque3 sive receptus

60—72. The reasonableness and neces—
sity of some liberty in the invention of
words is enforced by the reflection‚ in
the vein of half playful moralizing corn-
mon to the Epistles, that language can-
not continue in one stay more than hu-
man life and its other products Horace
has in mind Homer's similitude οἵη περ
φύλλων γενεή, τοίη δὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν, κ.τ.λ.
Il. 6. 146.

in annos : ‘from year to year,' as ‘ in-
dies‚’ ‘in horas‘ (Od. 2. 13. 14, Sat. 2.
7. 10, and inf. v. 160); pronos adds
‘as they run smoothly, swistly'; so
‘ pronos Volvere menses ’ Od. 4. 6. 39.

61. prima eadunt, ‘ those that corne
first fall.’ The two statements about
the leaves answer to the two about words,
but in the reversed order. The woods
get new leaves every year, ‘the leaves
that carne first drop off— so old words
die and new ones take their place.' Pros.
Nettleship (Essays in Lat. Lit. p. 176)
has an ingenious argument to show that
the text originally ran ‘prima cadunt:
nova succrescunt: vetus interit aetas.'
The facts he produces are curious, but
the difficulties of the existing text seem
to have been exaggerated. If the alter-
native were accepted a new difficulty
would arise ; the words ‘ ita verborum ³
having vanished, there would be nothing
to imply that ‘vetus interit aetas ' was
said of words. It could hardly be so
understood. In that case the generation
of leaves would become a similitude sor
the generations of humanity, the appli—
cation of the law to language would
be postponed till v. 69. This would
be very unlike Horace's lightness of
hand.

63—68. It is natural to a Roman,
enforcing the lesson that the works of
m01tal hands cannot be imperishable,
to think of the great operations of
Roman engineering. It is natural to
Horace to choose operations which are
associated with the Emperor or his
friends. Nor is it a bad compliment
to Augustus, as some have suggested,
for the point of naming them is that

they are the extreme instances of mar-
vellous and durable human works. No-
tice also that the three operations have
a special link in that they all display
in a particular matter the power of re-
versing the conditions of nature: ‘land
has been turned into sea. water into
dry land, running water has been made to
find a new channeL' The first instance
can hardly but be Agrippa's great work
of making the Portus Julius by the
union of the Lucrine lake with the
Avernian: see Merivale‚ vol. iii. ch. 27,
and cp. Virg. Georg. 2. 161. It stands
with Virgil as the single instance of
an artificia] work to match the great
natural features of Italy. Cp. esp. the
two lines ‘ Iulia qua ponto longe sonat
unda refuso, Tyrrhenusque fretis immit-
titur aestus Avernis.' The last line
recalls ‘receptus terra Neptunus,’ and
perhaps the slight conceit which gives
a point to the two lines, ¹ the sea is kept
out of the Lucrine while it is admitted
to the Avernian,' has also its parallel
in Horace's triplet. The other two
seem to refer to the draining of the
Pomptine marshes, and some turning
of the course of the Tiber with the
purpose of preventing floods; but the
facts are not known to us. The Scho-
liasts assert that the first of these works
was executed by Augustus. Plutarch
tells us (Jul. Caes. 58) that it had been
planned by Julius Caesar3 and the
canal through the marshes, by which
we find Horace travelling (in Sat. 1.
5), was probably connected with this
purpose; but there is no notice in his-
tory of the work having been completed.
Augustus may well have carried it fur-
ther, and we may allow for some exag-
geration in Horace's tone about it. In
spite of the advocacy of Profs. Nettle-
ship and Wilkins, Ι cannot accept Prel-
ler⁷s view (see Orelli's excursus iv.) that
Horace is referring to the projects of
Julius Caesar, not to works actually
executed. The tenses and moods seem
unsuitable: the emphatic praise ‘regis
opus ³ is wasted on a dream; the com-
pliment to Augustus is dubious: ‘all
human works shall perish, even your
great father’s purposes if they are ever
