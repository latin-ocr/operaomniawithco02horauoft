LIB. II.

SAT. 5.

Nudus inopsque domum redeam, te vate, neque illic
Aut apotheca procis intacta est aut pecus; atqui
Et genus et virtus nisi cum re vilior alga est.
‘Quando pauperiem, missis ambagibus, horres,

Accipe qua ratione queas ditescere.

Turdus 10

Sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc

Res ubi magna nitet domino sene; dulcia poma

Et quoscunque feret cultus tibi fundus honores

Ante Larem gustet venerabilior Lare =dives;

Qui quamvis periurus erit, sine gente, cruentus 15
Sanguine fraterno, fugitivus, ne tamen illi

Tu comes exterior si postulet ire recuses.’

6. te vate, Epod. 16.66; ‘according
to your prophecy'; i. e. in Odyss. 11.
1 1 3.

7. apotheca, ‘ storeroom,' and especi—
ally the room upstairs, and often con-
nected with the chimney, where wine
was stored. See on Od. 3. 8. 11 3. 21. 7,
3. 28. 7 (it is called there ‘horreum').
Cp. Cic. Phil. 2. 27. 67.

8. vilior alga, a proverbial com-
parison. Virg. Eel. 7. 42 ‘ proiecta vilior
alga’: cp. Od. 3, 17. 10 “alga inutili)

9. missis ambagibus. These words
are best taken neither (as the Schol.
followed by Orelli, but against tl.e
natural order) with ‘accipe‚' nor (as
Heind.) with ‘ horres‚' but with the
whole sentence: ‘Let us use plainness
of speech.’ It apologizes for the blunt-
ness of describing what Ulysses dreads
as ‘pauperies‚' and what he seeks as
‘ ditescere) These words occupy the
emphatic places. ‘Pauper-ies· has in
Horace's language almost a technical
sense; see on Od.1.1.18‚ Epp.1.1.45.
The word transfers the question from the
heroic age to the age of the poet. ‘The
complaint is the very one so dreaded in
our Roman society, the prescription may
well be the same which it adopts.’

10. turdus, ‘ obeso Nil melius turdo '
Epp. 1. 15. 41. For the orn. of‘ sive’
before ‘ ‘turdus’ see on Od.1.3.16‚1.6. 19.

11. privum (Epp. 1. 1. 93), to be
taken with dabitur, for ‘ your own pecu-
liar eating.' It is a phrase of Lucilius.

devolet: a humorous adaptation to
the first—named present.

12. poma. Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 78 ‘sunt qui
F rustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras.’

13. honores: see on Od. 1. 17. 16

‘ruris honorum‚' i. e. fruit, flowers. etc.

14. ante Larem,i.e.the Lares Rurales,
who guarded the interests of the husband-
man, and to whom offerings were made
of his produce. See an excellent note
by Prof. G. G. Ramsay on Tibullus 1. 1.
20. ‘ Consuetudo fuit ut rerum primitias
Laribus ponerent ' Porph.

15. sine gente: either because he is
ofservile origin or because he hasbecome
‘ capite deminutus.'

16. fugitivus, one who has never
even, legitimately‚ obtained his freedom 3
cp. Sat. 1. 5. 66.

17. exterior, i. e. as the Schol.
explains, ‘ on the left side‚’ which is that
on which a walker is more defenceless.
To take the left hand os a companion
was called ‘latus claudere’ Juv. S. 3. 131,
or, as here, ‘tegere ’; cp. Suet. Claud.
24, where it is used of an act of con-
descension ofClaudius towards his friend
Plautius. EutropiuS, relating the same
incident, uses the phrase ‘laevus ince-
deret.’ Ovid has the correlative ‘interior '
in speaking of two men walking to-
gether, Fast. 5.67.

si postulet: not ‘ ask you to take
that position,' but ‘ask you to wall<
abroad with him.' Ifhe asked it would be
assumed that he did so as the supe1i0r.

ne recuses. See note on Sat. 2. 3. 88.
This is, if the text is sound, an instance
of the pres. subj. in prohibition which
does not admit, as possibly that does,
of being explained away. Those who,
on such grounds, are ready to alter texts
may perhaps accept the reading of the
St. Gall MS. (σ) ‘ non,' comparing v. 91
of this Satire ‘ non sileas '; but it seems
safer to allow that Horace, who has
