48 HORATII SATIRARUM

Ignoscent si quid peccaro stultus amici, · 140'
Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter,
Privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.

140. stultus: not being a philosopher.

SATI RE IV.

AN APOLOGY FOR WRITING SATIRE.

IT should be noticed that Horace in v. 71 soll. expressly repudiates the idea of
publishing his Satires. He composes them sor his own pleasure and profit, and
only reads them to friends, and when pressed to do so.

With this Satire should be compared Sat. 1. 3. and 2. 1.

Verses 1—7. Satire in Lucilius' hands came straight from the great comic poets
of Greece, who, when they saw a rogue, had no scruple in painting him as
such. The spirit is identical, the metre only changed.

7—13. In spite of high merits he failed in point of form, from thinking of quantity
rather than quality.

13—21. That is the mistake of people like Crispinus, not mine.

21—38. Yet this does not secure me popularity. Poetasters, like Fannius, have
fame, but Ι have not ventured to publish, and 1 have not the courage to recite-
Why is Satire unpopular‘.² Because so many people know that its shafts may
fairly be aimed at them. They accuse the poet of trading on the weaknesses
of his friends.

38-56. Hear my reply. Let me say first that they do me too great honour if they
call me a ‘poet.’ Ι do not claim the name. It is an old question whether
comedy is poetry. Its language is the language of common lise :

56-62. its passion the passion of common life. Take to pieces a line of Ennius,
and the fragments are the fragments of a poet. Do the same for Lucilius,
and you have nothing that marks the poet.

63-65. But we will leave this question, and ask again why Satire is looked on so
'ealousl .

65-7J8. Youysuggest that my trade is that of the informer. I might answer that it
is the guilty, not the innocent, who dread even the informer. But I am very

unlike an informer. Ι seek no publicity, even in days when no place is sacred
from recitations.

78-79. You say I take pleasure in giving pain.
79—91. You must ask my friends about that. True malignity is to be found in the

gossip of private life. But you who are so much on the look out for malignity
listen with pleasure to the illnatured buffoonery of the supper table.
