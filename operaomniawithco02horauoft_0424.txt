HORATII ARS POETICA.

Defendat‚ neu quid medios intercinat actus

Quod non proposito conducat et haereat apte.

195

Ille bonis faveatque et consilietur amice,

Et regat iratos et amet peccare timentes3
Ille dapes laudet mensae brevis, ille salubrem
Iustitiam legesque et apertis otia portis;

Ille tegat commissa deosque precetur et oret,

200

Ut redeat miseris, abeat fortuna superbis.
Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta tubaeque

τὸν χορὸν δὲ ἕνα δεῖ ὑπολαβεῖν τῶν
ὑποκριτῶν. καῖ μόριον εἶναι τοῦ ὅλου καὶ
συναγωνίζεσθαι μὴ ὥσπερ Εὐριπίδῃ ἀλλ’
ὥσπερ Σοφοκλεῖ. τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς τὰ
ᾀδόμενα (οὐ) μᾶλλον τοῦ μύθου ἢ ἄλλης
τραγῳδίας ἐστίν· διὸ ἐμβόλιμα καλοῦσιν,
πρῶτον ἄρξαντος Ἀγάθωνος τοῦ τοιούτου.
Horace's other rules are not to be found
in Aristone, but they correspond With
the character of the chorus as we find it
in the Greek tragedies.

194. defendat: Sat. 1. 10. 12.

intercinat aetus: as is pointed out
on v. 189 ‘actus ' is here evidently the
rough equivalent of the Greek ἐπεισόδια,
including in them the πρόλογος and
ἔξοδος, or dialogue before the first and
after the last choric song.

197. peecare timentes is the only
reading that has good authority. Bentley
objected to it as tautologous after ‘ bonis
faveat} and as putting an unlikely force
on ‘ amet‚⁷ the language of the chorus
rather than their feelings being in ques-
tion. The words however describe very
truly the attitude of the chorus i say in the
Antigonen as shrinking from breaches of
law and propriety and disposed at first
to throw cold water on bold resolves.
Bentl. proposed ‘ pacare tumentes,' there
being some slight MS. authority to be
quoted for both words. Keller would
read ‘pacare timentes,' but allowing that
‘ peccare ' was the reading of the arche-
t e.

y1i98. The chorus is to sing the praise

of moderation. So Aesch. Eum. 530
παντὶ μέσῳ τὸ κράτος θεὸς ὤπασεν. Cp.
Agam⁴ 378, 472.

mensae brevis: so ‘cena brevis’
Epp. 1. 14. 35.

199, apertis portis: Od. 3. 5. 23·

200. tegat eommjssa. Forthe words
cp. Epp. 1. 18. 38. Thus Orestes to
the chorus in Aesch. Cho. 555 αἰνῶ δὲ
κρύπτειν τάσδε συνθήκας ἐμάς, Soph. El.

469, etc. As the chortis was constantly
present, this reticence was a necessary
condition.

deos precetur: Aesch. Cho. 784 and

31.

9 201. redeat, abeat fortuna. The
essence of a tragedy according to Aris-
totle is the περιπέτεια or reversal of
conditions (ἐξ εὐτυχίας εἷς δυστυχίαν or
the opposite). The Chorus is to favour
the catastrophe which satisfies the moral
sense.

202—2 19. The discussion on the chorus
leads to one on stage music, of which
Horace gives an historical sketch, sug-
gested possibly by the memory of some
Greek treatise; but see the passages
quoted from Cicero and Quintilian on
v. 211, and from Pliny in the next note.
In some details he seems certainly to pass
to Roman practice. He condemns the
modern instrumental music as an after-
growth alien to the true spirit of the
drama. This was a grievance of early
date in Greece, as seems from a story
told by Athenaeus (14. 8, p. 617) of
Pratinas, the predecessor of Aeschylus,
who complained that the fluteplayers
no longer accompanied the chorus but
rather the chorus the fluteplayers‚ and
vented his wrath on the musicians in the
following ‘hyporchema,' τίς ὃ θόρυβος
ὅδε; τί τάδε τὰ χορεύματα; τίς ὕβρις
ἔμολεν ε’πῖ Διονυσιάδα πολυπάταγα θυμέ-
λαν, κ.τ.λ. We should remember that the
ancients always attributed moral effect
to any departure from the severity of the
older music. Aristode, who recognizes
μελοποιία as an essential part of
tragedy, gives no detailed consideration
to it.

202. tibia non ut, nune. The mis-
chief began in the improvement of the
instrument.

orichalco vincta: Virg. Aen. 12.
87, Cic. de Off. 3. 23. 92. When used,
