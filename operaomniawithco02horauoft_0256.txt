HORATII EPISTULARUM

Si latus aut renes morbo temptantur acuto

Quaere fugam morbi.

Vis recte vivere: quis non?

Si virtus hoc una potest dare, fortis omissis 30

Hoc age deliciis.

Virtutem verba putas et

Lucum ligna: cave ne portus occupet alter,

Ne Cibyratica, ne Bithyna negotia perdas;

Mille talenta rotundentur, totidem altera, porro et

Tertia succedant et quae pars quadrat acervum3¹> 35
Scilicet uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos ἶ

Et genus et formam regina Pecunia donat,

‘the best and greatest of kings.‘ See

on Od. 4. 7. 17, Lucr. 3.1025.

28. si latus⁷ etc. This verse, sub-
stituting ‘ cum ’ for ‘ si,' and the subj.
for the ind„ occurs in Sat. 2. 3. 1633 see
note there. The original text ‘nil ad-
mirari ' is now exhausted, and he turns
to other conceptions of the ‘summum
bouum,' putting between the two parts
of the Epistle the principle which gives
it its true thread. This is expressed in
a figurative form: ‘If you are ill you
would take some pains to be well.’
The relation between the two members
of the analogical comparison is ex-
pressed‚ in the absence of conjunctions,
by assimilating the form of sentences,
two imperatives‚ as though he said
‘when Ι bid you choose your ideal
and pursue it with spirit, it is only as
though I bade you do what you would
do without my bidding, namely‚ try to
get well if you were ill.⁷

²9· reete vivere, ‘to guide your life
aright‚’ ‘to follow the true end whatever
it is.' See on Epp. Ι. 2. 41.

quis non? ‘All men have their
ideal.'

30. omissis deliciis, for they belong
to another ideal, pleasure.

31. hoc age, ‘to business!’ ‘give
your whole attention,’ Sat. 2. 3. 152,
Epp. 1. 18. 88.

virtutem verba putas. This an-
swers not to ‘ vis recte vivere,' but to ‘ si
virtus hoc una potest dare.' We may
mark it as a question, or take it as a
supposition. The reference is probably
to Brutus' last words, ὦ τλῆμον ἀρετή,
λόγος ἄρ’ ἧσθ’, ἐγὼ δέ σε Ι ὡς ἔργον
ἤσκουν. See note on Od. 2. 7. 11,
and cp. Epp. 1. 17. 41 ‘Aut virtus
nomen inane est Aut‚' etc. Bentl.
preferred ‘ puteS‚’ which is in some good

MSS.‚,as more modest: ‘you may possibly
think.

‘Are you a man who takes a purely
material account of everything, who
thinks w'rtue a thing to talk of but of
no substantial existence, who thinks a
sacred grove so many yards of timber;
seek then with vigour the ideal which
suits your view, namel y, material wealth.’

33. Cibyratica. Cibyra was a town
in the south of Phrygia, on the borders
of Caria and Lycia. It gave its name
to one of the largest ‘conventus’ in
Roman Asia Minor, that one, namely‚
of which Laodicea was the chief town.
Strabo, 13. 4. 17, speaks of an iron trade
at Cibyra. Bp. Lightfoot (Introd. to
Ep. to Colossinus, ‘Churches of the
Lycus ’) thinks that the phrase ‘Ciby-
ratica negotia’ refers rather to the trade
of Laodicea.

Bithyna : Od. 3. 7. 3 ‘ Thyna merce
beatum.’

perdas, i. e. if any one forestals you.

34. retundentur, ‘ rotundo ' and
‘ corrotundo ' are used for ‘ to make up a
round sum.'

35. quae pars quadrat, ‘ the fourth
thousand which makes the heap four
times the original.' The MSS. vary
between ‘quadrat ’ and ‘quadret' ; either
can stand.

36. seilicet: ironical, and marking
that the sentiment is not Horace's but
that of the votary of wealth ; ‘of course,
you know.’

fidem: cp. Juv. S. 3. 143 ‘ Quantum
quisque sua nummorum servat in arca,
Tantum habet et fidei)

37. et genus et formam. Schiitz
seems right in saying that there is a
parody of the Stoic paradoxes of the
perfectiori of the wise man, ‘liber
honoratus pulcher rex denique regum.’
