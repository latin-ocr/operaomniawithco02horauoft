Musa supervacuas Antonius, et tamen illis
Me facit invisum, gelida cum perluor unda

Per medium frigus.

Sane murteta relinqui, 5

Dictaque cessantem nervis elidere morbum

Sulphura contemni, vicus gemit, invidus aegris,

Qui caput et stomachum supponere fontibus audent
Clusinis Gabiosque petunt et frigida rura.

Mutandus locus est et deversoria nota ιο

Praeteragend us equus.

‘ Quo tendis?

Non mihi Cumas

Est iter aut Baias‚' laeva stomachosus habena

nam introduces a long parenthesis,
the indirect questions being resumed at
v. 14. There is a similar parenthesis
introduced by ‘nam’ in vv. 16—21.

3. Musa Antonius. The freedman-
physician who enred Augustus in ΒΕ.
23 of an illness by the cold water treat-
ment, Suet. Aug. 59 and 81, Dion C. 53.
30. This proves nothing as to the date
of Horace's adopting a like treatment,
but it suits well with the date which is
otherwise assigned to the Epistles of
this book. For the order of the two
names see on Od. 2. 2. 3.

supervacuas. Baiae was resorted
to for its sulphur Vapour baths. Horace
being put on cold water would find
no use in it beyond other watering
places.

et tamen, ‘and yet,’ i. e. though it
is the doctor’s fiat, not my fancy, and
though I am told that their specialty is
of no use sor my case. The passage
well hits off the way that the whole
population of a health-resort‚ officials
and visitors alike, espouse its cause as a
point of personal honour, and look on
any one who undervalues its treatment
or goes elsewhere as guilty of a grave
delinquency.

5. sane, ‘really.' The word which
the champions of Baiae would use in
beginning their indignant outburst;
cp⁴ its use in Epp. 1. 7. 61, A. P.
418.

murteta. Celsus 2. 17 describes the
treatment ; the myrtle woods are the lo-
cality: ‘naturalium sudationum ubi a
terra profusus vapor aedificio includi-
tur, sicut super Baias in murtetis.'

6. nervis elidere. ‘ Elidere' seems
to have been a technical medical word,
for the ‘dislodgement' of a malady‚

Cels. 2. 15.
rheumatism.

9. Clusinis, of, or near, Clusium in
Etruria. There is no other allusion to
them nor any trace of medicinal springs
there. It has been thought that the
reference is to some baths twelve miles
south of Clusium, at a place now called
S. Casciano di Bagni.

Gabiosque: see on Epp. 1. 1 1. 7, with
the quotation from Juv. S. 10. 100 ⁴' Bal-
neolum Gabiis? W'e learn from this
place that it was a place of cold bath-

The malady seems to be

ing. It is to be noted that Horace does
not say nor even imply that he went
himself to Clusium or Gabii. They are
named as speeimens of the rival estab-
lishments whose names stunk in the
nostrils of the votaries of Baiae. He
had ‘frigida rura’ in his Sabine hills,
and cold water which he pronounces
medicinal for head and stomach; see
Epp. Ι. 16. 14.

10. mutandus locus est, pursues
the explanation which was broken off in
v. 5 to picture the annoyance of the
people os Baiae. The result of Musa's
advice is that I must change my desti-
nation, not take as usual the turning to
Baiae, but continue the road toward
Salernum.

deversoria nota: ‘the inns he (i. e.
the horse) knows,’ acc. after ‘praeter-
agendus’ They are the inns on the
road between Baiae and the place where
the Appian Way was left; the horse as-
sociates the turning with the baiting-
places to which it led.

11. quo tendis? part of the im-
patient ridel-'s address to the horse who
from old habit is turning off to the
right.
