DE ARTE POETICA LIBER.

Verses 1—5. YOU expect a picture to represent something real: not incongruous
and impossible combinations.

6—13. The same rule binds a poet. What he coneeives (i. e. whether as a whole
or in details must be possible and whole.

14-23. This rule is violated by the ‘ purple pateh ' system. Your beauties must
be relevant. Remember always your purpose and its conditions.

24—31. Blunders in this matter proceed from the common failing, the incapacity
to avoid one mistake without falling into its opposite. One wants art even
to escape faults.

32-37. It is the same in sculpture. It is easier to work up some details than to
conceive a whole. But it is as in the human face : a crooked nose spoils the
effect of good eyes and hair.

38—41. The key lies in choosing a subject within your powers. Once do that
and you will not fail either in finding plenty to say or in power to arrange it.

42-45. By arrangement I mean knowing when to say a thing, when to omit or
postpone it, the power to pick and ehoose.

46—72. That must be exercised in respect of diction. It is a very happy knack
to make an old word new by a skilsul conjunction. You may also invent
words if it be necessary3 but it must be in moderation, and you will do well
to go to Greek as your well-spring. The old poets invented words, why may
not modern? Words, like other human things, have their day, and pass
and change.

73-88. The different types of poetry have been marked out by the Greek masters,
and stamped with their appropriate mctres, and we must keep to them.

89—118. So generally with respect to the szyle of dz‘ctzbn. The comic and the
tragic are distinct, though of course to a certain extent each borrows the tone
of the other. This is owing to the larger law that emotion is only stirred
by emotion, and the language must correspond to the emotion. Respect
must be had too to the characters who are speaking.

119-127. In respect of characters you may follow tradition or invent. In either
case you have your law. Traditional characters must keep their traditional
features. Newly invented ones must be consistent with their own idea.

’ 128-135. Real originality in dealing with common things is so difficult that you
are doing better to dramatize some of the Homeric story than to start a new
plot. There is room for originality still within these limits, in the choice of
your subject and in the freedom of your imitation.

136-152. Imitate Homer in the modesty of your beginning, in avoiding lengthy χ
and prosaic introductions, in consisteney of story.
