HORATII EPISTULARUM

Frigus collegit, furnos et balnea laudat

Ut fortunatam plene praestantia vitam.

Nec si te validus iactaverit Auster in alto, ις,
Idcirco navem trans Aegaeum mare vendas.

Incolumi Rhodos et Mytilene pulchra facit quod

Paenula solstitio, campestre nivalibus auris,

Per brumam Tiberis, Sextili mense caminus.

Dum licet ac voltum servat Fortuna benignum, 20
Rornae laudetur Samos et Chios et Rhodos absens.

Tu quamcunque deus tibi fortunaverit horam

Grata sume manu, neu dulcia differ in annum,

Ut quocunque loco fueris vixisse libenter

13. frigus collegit: so ‘ sitim col—
ligere’ Ov. Met. 5. 446 ; cp. Virg. G. 3.
327. Possibly a poetica] variation of
the prose use of ‘ contrahere ⁷; ‘ has got
chilled through.'

furnos et balnea: he would like to
warm himself, but he does not therefore
place the sum of happiness in having
access to ovens (as a baker), or hot
water (as a bathman). For ‘furnos'
see on Sat. 1. 4. 37.

15. neo: ‘ so neither,’ etc.

16. vendas, i. e. with the idea of
staying there for your lise.

17. incolumi. Editors question
whether this means sound in health or in
sense : ‘mentis sanae ' Schol. Surely no
exact interpretation is to be given. It
answers to and applies in the widest
sense to the drenching of v. 11, the chill
of v. 13, the tossing of v. 15. Remedies
are for the sick. If you want to travel,
there is unsoundness somewlzere. No
doubt in the end the disease is to be
traced to the mind.

Rhodos et Mytilene: an echo of
Od. Ι. 7. Ι. They stand here sor foreign
travel generally.

facit quod: does the same service
as, uo more service than.

18. paenula: a woollen cloak worn
in rainy weather, see Mayor on Juv.
S. 5. 79 ‘ multo stillaret paenula nimbo.’

solstitio, ‘midsummer‚' as in Virg.
E. 7. 47, G. 1. 100.

campestre. For the adj. cp. A. P.
379 ‘ campestribus armis.' The neut. sing.
was used of a light apron or drawers
worn in exercises of the Campus Mar-
tius.

19. TiberiS, i.e. for bathing.
Sextili : see on Epp. 1. 7. z.
caminus: Sat. 1. 5. 81.

20. dum lieet: with a glance at the
chauces of Roman life. ‘ The time may
come when you may have no choice.’
The banished Ovid imitates the line,
Trist. 1. 5. 27 ‘ Dum iuvat et voltu ridet
Fortuna sereno.‘

21. Romae laudetur. The emphasis
on ‘ laudetur’ is the same as on Virgil's
(G. 2. 415) ‘Laudato ingentia rura:
exiguum colito.' Cp. also the force put
upon ‘contemplere' in Od. 3. 29. 7,
‘look [wistfullyj at, without going to
them.' ‘ Romae‘ might mean ‘ stay at
Rome and praise,’ ete.‚ or ‘ come back
to Rome and praise‚’ etc. The latter is
probably the sense z see introduction to
the Epistle. Notice that the three
places have all been named in the
Episde, so that this is the summing up.

absens: as an epithet of the place
from which one is absent ; see Sat. 2.

. 28.

7 22. tu, as always, the note of en-
treaty: Od. 1.9. 16, 1.11.1; Sat. 1. 4.
85; Epp.1. 2. 63.

quamcunque . . . horam. The tone
of Od. 3. 8. 27 ‘ Dona praesentis rape
laetus horae ’ and 3. 29. 29. As in Od. 2.
16. 18-25 he identifies the restlessness
which makes men travel for pleasure
with the vice which he is always assail-
ing of not making the most of pleasures
which they have.

23. dulcia: your pleasant things, i.e.
the enjoyment of them.

in annum: see Epp. 1. 2. 39.

24. libenter: ‘as though life were
