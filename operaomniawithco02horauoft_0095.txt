SAT. 7.

83

Rupilius Rex, who had been one of those who, in jealousy of Horace’s rank as
tribune, taunted him with his parentage (Sat. 1. 6. 40).

PROSCRIPTI Regis Rupili pus atque venenum

Hybrida quo pacto sit Persius ultus, opinor

Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.

Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat

Clazomenis, etiarn lites cum Rege molestas, 5
Durus homo atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,
Confidens tumidusque, adeo sermonis amari,

Sisennas, Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.

Ad Regem redeo.

1. Proscripti Regis. The play on
his name begins with the first line
in this juxtaposition, ‘that outlawed
King,⁷ as though he were another
Tarquin.

pus atque venenum, metaphorically
of ¹ foul and venomous ’ utterance. Lu-
cilius had possibly used the word in
the same sense, fr. 15. 13. Nothing
is known of Rupilius Rex but what
Horace tells us. The Scholiasts iden—
tify him unwarrantably with P. Ru-
pilius ‘ magister publicanorum ’ in
Bithynia, mentioned in Cic. ad Fam. 13.
9. 2. A misunderstanding of ‘Pro-
scripti’ (which means probably pro-
scribed by the Triumvirs) leads them to
describe him as ‘a civibus Praenestinis
in exilium missus?

2. hybrida, ‘ mongreL' or ‘half-
bred': ‘ patre Asiatico matre Romana’
Schol. for literal use cp. Plin. N. H. 1. 79
‘ in nullo genere aeque (atque in suibus)
facilis mixtura cum fero, qualiter natos
antiqui hybridas vocabant ' : for metaph.
cp. Suet. Aug. 19 ‘ Asinii Epicadi ex
gente Parthina hybridae,’ Mart. 8.
22. 2.

3. lippis et tonsoribus = hearers
and purveyors of gossip. Cp. Plautus,
Amphit. 4. 1. 5, os places where loun—
gers would be looked for, ‘ in medicinis,
in tonstrinis . . . sum defessus quaesi-
tando.' The point of the line iS‚ ‘ all the
world knows the story—perhaps I may
tell it again?

6. odio, in a passive sense as in Ter.
Hec. 1. 2. 48 ‘ tundendo atque odio,'
of offensive language and manner.

7. confidens, a word which by Cicero's
time (Tusc. 3. 7. 14) had aequired a

Postquam nihil inter utrumque

bad meaning, ‘bold‚’ ‘audacious.’ In
Plautus it is used in a good sense.

tumidus, ‘blustering.² Cp. A. P.
94 ‘Iratus . . . tumido delitigat ore.’
Many MSS. add ‘ que,' but it was want—
ing in V.

8. sisennas, Barros, ‘such men as
Sisenna and Barrus,’ names unknown
to us in this connection-standing in-
stances (possibly in Lucilius) of bitter
tongues.

equis albis, apparently the same pro-
verbial expression as in Plaut. Asin. 2.
2. 13 ‘Nam si huic occasioni tempus
sese subterduxerit, Nunquam edepol
quadrigis albis indipiscet postea.' Two
explanations are given by the Schol.
(1) ‘albis, sc. velocioribus,⁷ according to
Homer‘s λευκότεροι χιόνος θείειν δ’ ἀνέ-
μοισιν ὁμοῖοι, of the horses of Rhesus,
11. 10. 437, imitated by Virgil, Aen. 12.
84; (2)⁴ ‘quasi quadrigis triumphalibus‚'
‘ trimnphantly,' white horses being used
in the triumphal procession. The first
is the most likely, as suiting best the
use in Plautus.

9. ad Regem. Not an exact expres-
sion, for he does not ‘come back to
Rex' in the sense of deseribing him
as he has described Persius. The
meaning seems rather to be that he
passes from the general description of
Persius to the special story of his rela-
tion to Rex.

postquam, ‘ when they cannot settle
their differences between them': the
apodosis is lost in the long parenthesis
that follows, for when in v. 18 we re-
sume the direct statement, we begin
again as though there was no temporal
protasis still pendant.
