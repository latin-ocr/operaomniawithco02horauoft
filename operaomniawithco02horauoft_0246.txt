HORATII EPISTULARUM

Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posseS,

Gratia nequicquam coit et rescinditur, ac vos

dedication to Bacchus than ofhis van-
quishing other poets) helps here to the
generalizing of the 'words to cover the
prizes of other learned pursuits.

26. frigida curarum fomenta. This
phrase has been much discussed, but it
seems to be simply explained by the
Ciceronian use of the metaphor, ‘haec
sunt solacia, haee fomenta summorum
dolorum' Tnsc. D. 2. 24. 59, and by Ho-
race's own ‘Fomenta volnus nil malum
levantia⁷ Epod. 11. 25, where the last
words answer to the general epithet
‘ frigida.’ The sense will then be ¹ Yon
are sure to win distinction, if that is
your aim, in oratory, jmisprudence,
poetry. You might attain to the more
celestial heights to which philosophy
conducts, if you would dis-card the ano-
dynes to care which have not the first
condition of comfort.’ How close the
application, what the special career of
Florus, what the anodynes with which he
sought to mitigate them, whether wealth,
luxury, the objects of ambition. or the
like, we have no niaterials for guess-
ing. Generally we may compare for the
figure Epp. Ι. 2. 47 soll.‚ Od. 3. Ι. 41
foll. In the ‘caelestis sapientia' and
the figure of ‘duc-eret, ires,' we have,
perhaps a distant echo of Lucret. 2. 7
foll. ‘ Edita doctriua sapientum, templa
serena,⁷ etc.

28. hoe opus: the task os attaining
the true philosophica] mind: ‘quod
Aeque pauperibus prodest locupletibus
aeque, Aeque neglectum pueris seni-
busque nocebit' Epp. 1. 1. 24. For
‘ properemus ’ see Epp. 1. 2. 61 n.

29. nobis cari: cp. ‘Quid minuat

curas, quid te tibi reddat amicum ¹ Epp.
1. 18. 101, where ‘quid minuat euras‘
answers to ‘fomenta curarum' of this
passage.

30. sit. This is the reading of the
best MSS, including all the Bland„
and was interpreted by Porph. (‘ deest
an’). Orelli and Ritter follow Bentley
in preferring ‘ si‚' though it has little au-
thority, Orelli as the ‘ lectio difficilior ’ς
Ritter thinking that ‘ si’ was turned to
‘sit' by the sequence of ‘tibi.' With
either reading a direct question begins
with ⁴ an male.’

31 foll. ‘ Or does your broken friend-
ship, like a wound ill-stitched, close
to no purpose and tear open again;
and do you suffer still, in the fiereeness
of untamed necks‚ be it from hot blood
or from ignorance of life’ ?

31. sarta. The edd. show that both
‘ sarcieri’ and ‘ coire’ are medical terms
for the artificial and natural processes
of elosing a wound.

32· ae. So the best MSS. Orelli fol—
lows the early editions (before Bentley)
in reading ‘ at,' marking the question
at ‘rescinditurP’ For ‘gratia coit et
rescinditur' cp. Epp. 1. 18. 41 ‘gratia
dissiluit?

33. seu . . . seu seems the certain
reading, though many good MSS„ in-
cluding all the Bianti„ had ‘heu...
heu? Acron interprets ‘seu.’

35. indigni rumpere.
Dillr. point out that this is an inaccu-
rate expression, being: ‘ quos indign m
est, non decet, rumpere,’ after the mo 'el
of the Greek idiom with ἄξιος, δίκαιος,
and the like.
