TO THE SATIRES. 13

again a spendthrift, and in the second passage of that Satire a
dramatic picture is given of his way of inviting the purveyors of
luxury and vice to help him dispose of his fortune. In 2. 8 he is
one of Nasidienus' two ‘scurrae‚’ the other being ‘Porcius' We
notice there that Nasidienus is evidently a disguised name, if not an
invented character, and it is necessary therefore that though the guests
are real persons the ‘scurrae' of the host should have fictitious
names. That of Porcius can hardly but be explained by ‘ Ridiculus
totas simul absorbere placentas' of his greedy mode of eating.
Nomentanus is therefore, as elsewhere, a typical not a personal name.
Now Nomentanus occurs in two fragments of Lucilius (2. 6. and 8) as
the name of a man whom he is exposing and to whom he wishes ill.
Yet the Schol. explains the name in Horace of one L. Cassius Nomen-
tanus, who spent 7‚000,000 sesterces on his gluttony, and whose cook
Dama was hired by Sallustius Crispus. Even if there was such a
person, we may yet think it probable that Horace was thinking, not
of him, but of the Lucilian Nomentanus.

Horace refers from time to time to characters and scenes of
Terence (1. 2. 20, 2. 3. 262 f.), and there is one reference which the
Scholiast on A. P. 237 points out to a play of Caecilius ¹. But for his
purpose the mimes and ‘togatae2’ would be still more appropriate,
and that there are references to these in his writings can hardly be
doubted.

It should be noticed that the literary use of names from the poets
is quite in accordance with his way of using the prose author whom
he knew best. ‘ A doctor' in Sat. 2. 3. 161 is ‘ Craterus,' the doctor
of Cic. ad Att. 12. 13 and 14. The names that supply the dramatic
framework of Sat. 2. 2, and 3, and probably4, are from Cicero's letters.
It is analogous also to his use of Greek stories (as of Polemon in 2.
3. 254) and of Homeric and tragic personages (2. 3. 132 f. and
187 f.) ³³.

It has been often pointed out that some of Horace⁷s names are
adapted etymologically to the characters they indicate. That in
inventing names he should employ this device is natural. It has
been a device of satirists and allegorists in all ages, and he has
