SAT. 2.

Discite, non inter lances mensasque nitentes
Cum stupet insanis acies fulgoribus et cum
Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat,

Verum hic impransi mecum disquirite.

Dicam si potero.
Corruptus iudex.

Cur hoc ?

Male verum examinat omnis
Leporem sectatus equove

Lassus ab indomito, vel si Romana fatigat ιο
Militia assuetum graecari, seu pila velox

Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,

Seu te discus agit, pete cedentem ae'ra disco3

Cum labor extuderit fastidia, siccus inanis

Sperne cibum vilem3 nisi Hymettia mella Falerno 15

Ne biberis diluta.

sense as Horace, in asserting sor the
practical wisdom of Roman worthies a
claim to the title, in a certain sense, of
philosophy, but the use in the following
sentence and in the same connection of
the phrase ‘ pingui Minerva' makes it
most probable that Horace had his ac-
tual words in mind.

crassa Minerva, ‘homely mother wit.’
Cp. A. P. 385 ‘invita Minerva?

4. nitentes 3 with both subst. For the
extravagant outlay on tables see Mayor
on Juv. 5. 1. 137. Contrast ad Sat. 1. 3.
13 ‘sit mihi mensa tripes?

5. insanis. The edd. quote Cicero's
epithet forClodius' extravagant building
at Alba, ‘ substructionum insanae moles '
Mil. 31. 85.

6. acclinis, in a literal sense in Virg.
Aen. 10. 835 ‘ acclinis trunco’3 here
metaphorical, as Livy uses ‘ se acclinare
ad ⁷ for ‘ to incline towards,' 4. 48.

7. impransi. Sat. 2. 3. 257, Epp.
1. 15. 29 ; ‘before breaking your
fast.’

S. male verum examinat. For
another application of this principle see
A. P. 422 f.

9. sectatus, ‘ after following.’

10. ab. Virg. G. 1. 234 ‘torrida
semper ab igni,⁷ Madv. ξ 254 obs. 2 ; as
we say, ‘tired from) as well as ‘tired
with '; but there is perhaps the sense of
‘ coming from‚' ‘ fresh from?

Romana militia: the soldierly exer-
cises of a Roman—i. e. not military
exercises proper, but those named in the
preceding words, hunting and horse-
breaking ; with this comparison of Greek
and Roman exercises cp. Od. 3. 24. 54

Foris est promus et atrum

soll„ Epp. Ι. 18. 49 foll. For the ‘ pila*
and ⁴ discus ’cp. also Sat. 1. 5. 48, A. P.
380, Od. 1. 8. 10 foll.

11. seu pila velox.
understand ‘ te agit‚' and also the impera-
tive apodosis to answer to · pete ceden-
tem ae‘ra disco,’ ‘ play at ban!

12. studio, sc. ‘the spirit of emula-
tion‚' the interest of the game.

fallente. As Sat. 2. 7. 114 ‘somno
fallere curam.'

13. agit, ‘draws,' ‘attracts,’ as Cic.
Arch. 7. 16 ‘haec studia adolescentiam
anunt)

bpete, ‘ fling the quoit into the yielding
air.

¹4· eum labor extuderit takes up
again the main protasis which was
broken off by the alternatives offered,
‘ vel si,’ etc. ‘After a day's hunting or
riding (or, if you prefer ball or quoits,
play ball or quoits), in any case when
hard work has given you a healthy
appetite, etc.’

extuderit, ‘eiecerit,' ‘excusserit‚’ Acr.

15. sperne. ‘ Despise if you can.’

nisi Hymettia. Do not drink your
‘mulsum' (see on Sat. 2. 1. 56, 2. 4.
24) unless the honey is from Hy-
mettus Od. 2. 6. 14) and the wine of
Falernum.

16. Necessity has the same effect as
exercise. If you cannot get relishes.
