LIB. ΙΙ. SAT. 4. 161

praises of country life in Epod. 2 by putting them into the mouth of the ‘ fenerator
Alfius.‘ He chooses for the purpose an Epicurean of the last generation, known '
to him chiefly, perhaps only, as having been laughed at by Cicero.

2. Both Acr. and the Comm. Cruq., though giving the theory just stated
at the beginning of the Satire, and referring to it again on v. 88, have a note
on v. 47, which, unless it is corrupt, must belong to a rival tradition as to
the person of Catius and the point of the Satire. In its fullest form it runs
‘Irridet eum quod de opere pistorio in suo libro scribit de se ipso: Haec primus
invenit et cognovit Catius Miltiades? Nothing else is known of such a work
or person. Orelli, who leans to this explanation, imagines him to have been
a freedman of Cicero⁷s Catius.

3. A third view was suggested by Manso, and is advocated warmly by Prof.
Palmer. It is that Catius is a pseudonym intended thinly to veil the name
os C. Matius, the correspondent of Cicero (see especially ad Fam. 11. 27 and 28),
and the friend of Julius Caesar and of Augustus. Columella tells us that he
wrote a book on the art os cookery, divided into three parts, which were called
severally Coquus, Cetarius‚ Salgamarius. Pliny speaks of his having given his
name to an apple (N. H. 15. 143.

In any case the humour of the Satire probably consisted mainly in the mixture
of truisms and paradoxes on the subject, and in the introduction of authority
in a matter where each man should be allowed his own taste. Orelli well
compares Sat. 2. 2. 51 ‘ Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos Parebit pravi
docilis Romana iuventus.’

Notice also that the topics follow the usual course of a Roman supper ⁴ ab ovo
ad mala' (Sat. Ι. 3. 6).
