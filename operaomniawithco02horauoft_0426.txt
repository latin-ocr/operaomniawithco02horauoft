HORATII ARS POETICA.

Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum
Rusticus urbano confusus, turpis honesto?
Sic priscae motumque et luxuriem addidit arti

Tibicen traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem;

215

sic etiam fidibus voces crevere severis,

Et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praeceps,
Utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri
Sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis.

nobis virilis roboris manebat excidit, sed
qua laudes fortium canebantur quaque
et ipsi fortes canebant?

212. indoctus z cp. the eomplaint as
to the illiterate audiences in Epp. 2. 1.
183 f. ⁴ indocti, stolidique. ete.'

quid saperet. What taste, discri-
mination, should he have?

liber laborum, that is, out sor a
holiday, and so looking only for amuse-
ment. See below, v. 224. For gen.
ep. ¹ operum solutis’ Od. 3. 17. 16,
‘ operum vacuo ' Sat. 2. 2. 119.

213. turpis honesto. The distinc—
tion is of birth, as the ‘ plebecula’ and
the ‘ eques ' of the similar Epp. 2. 1.
186, 187, and see also vv. 248, 249. For
‘ honestus, ‘ respectable‚’ cp. Epp. 2.
1. ¹50·

214. sie . . . sio. This was the secret
of these progressive changes, the degra-
dation of the audience.

motum et luxuriem.
(Poet. 26. 1) speaks of it as a sign of
debased art in αὐληταί to eke out the
dramatie force of their music by bodily
movement and gesticulation. Cp. also
Cicero's words (1. c. on v. 211) of the
movements of neck and eyes. The two
words may be = ‘ motus luxuriosos,’and
there may be a sense of immodest as
well as excessive movement. So. Aer.
‘gestum corporis et voluptatem.' Ritter
prefers to take both words of the added
liveliness and variety of the music. Cp„
in that case, ‘cantus luxuria' in the
passage of Pliny quoted on v. 202.

215. vagus, as Orelli points out, an
ironical word, as though his movements
were aimless.

traxit vestem, i. e. the ‘ syrma’ or
trailing (σύρω) ‘ tragic robe.⁷ It is im-
plied that the robe itself is noticeable.
Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 207.

per pulpita t the expression belongs
to the Roman theatre, in which there
was no ‘ orchestra)

216. voces, ‘toness as in Virgil's

Aristotle

‘ septem discrimina vocum' Aen. 6. 646.

severis: cp. ‘severae Musa tragoe-
diae’ Od. 2. 1. 9. Plato allowed the
lyrein his ideal state (see Rep. 3. p. 399)
as the most staid and limited instrument,
while excluding altogether the αὐλός
as πολυχορδότατον, i. e. admitting the
largest number of tones. For the
changes in choral music attributed to
Timotheus, who is said to have added
the eleventh string to the lyre, already
inereased by a succession of innovators
srom the Heptachord of Terpander, see
Haigh‘s Attie Theatre‚ p. 294. The
contrast between the older music of
Aeschylus’ plays and the newer em—
ployed by Euripides is a subject of dis-
cussion in Aristophanes' Frogs.

217-219. A elever description of
obvious characteristics of the language
of a chorus in Greek tragedies, its
dithyrambic abruptness of metaphor and
its oracular sententiousness. Horace
connects them, more playfully perhaps
than historically, with the more florid
music which invaded the stage. The
point seems to be that the diction
matched the music in its unnaturalness.

217. eloquium insolitum3 an ironi-
cal phrase—a diction losty but strange.
alien indeed to that of common life.

praeceps, ‘bold‚' ‘abrupt,’ opposed
to the gentle flow of sober language—
‘dicendi genus quod praecipitia pro
sublimibus habet’ Quintil. 12. 10. 73.
Cp. the description of Pindar‘s diction
Od. 4. 2. 10 ⁶ per audaces nova dithy-
rambos Verba devolvit.'

tulit=‘secum attulit‚’
‘ effecit.'

218. utiliumque sagax rerum,
‘ with its wise saws.‘ With the genitives
cp. ‘divina imbrium' Od. 3. 27. 10 and
see Madv. ξ 289, obs. 1 and 2.

219. non discrepuit, ‘struck the
very same note as '—that is, they were
as obscure and unhelpful as the Delphic
oracles.
