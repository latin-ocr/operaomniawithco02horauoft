Non locus effusi late maris arbiter aufert,

worth living,' as ‘cenare libenter,' ‘ to
dine with appetite'; cp. Cic. ad Fam.
9.19.1. It is possible however that
‘libenter' is to be taken with ‘dicas'
and ‘ vixisse ’ absolutely, ‘ that you have
really lived,' as in Od. 3. 29. 43.

26. effusi late maris: ‘a broad
surface of sea.'

arbiter. Cp. Epod. 5. 50; Od. 3. 20.
11, 1. 3. 15, 2. 7. 25. These passages
give the stages in the use of‘arbiter.'
(1) ‘ The witness‚‘ as frequently in
Cicero ; (2) the impartial bystander act-
ing as umpire ; (3) the judge with power
to pronounce effective sentence, ‘po-
nere seu tollere? The present use is
perhaps nearest to (2), the image being
of sitting on high and overlooking the
sea with its tumults. There is a refer—

27. See on Od. 2. 16. 19 (cp. also
Epp. 1.14.12‚ 13). Horace had perhaps
in mind Aesch. in Ctes. 78 οὐ τὸν τρόπον
ἀλλὰ τὸν τόπον μόνον μετήλλαξεν, 01
Cic. pro Quintio 3. 12 ‘fit magna mu-
tatio loci non ingenii.’

28. strenua. nos exercet inertia:
travelling is ‘working hard at doing
nothing.’

navibus atque quadrigis: to be
taken literally; ‘by means of 10601110-
tion.’

29. bene vivere: a happy life, the
ideal of life3 Epp. 1. 6. 56.

30. Ulubris : a town near the Pomp-
tine marshes. Juvenal (S. 10. 101) calls
it ‘vacuae,’ classing it with Gabii and
Fidenae, in reminiscence therefore of
this Satire. Cicero jests about it in a

letter to Trebatius (ad Fam. 7. 18),
¹calling its citizens ‘little frogs.'
animus aequus: Epp. 1. 18. 112.

tius' defenee of Lebedus, so that a
stormy sea is specially in view.

ADDITIONAL NOTE ΟΝ VERsE 3.

Maiora minorave fama. Doubt hangs over both the reading and the meaning.
The earliest editors, followed by Bentley without comment, gave ‘ minorane.’
This is not found in any tenth cent. MSS. Holder gives ‘ne ’ as the reading of
Regin„ but this has ‘ ue' as has been verified. E has ‘ minoraque? Holder in the
edition of the text (1869) gave ‘ne‚' but his colleague Keller in the Epilegomena
(1869) has returned to ‘ve’ as the original and right reading. It is given by
Orell., Dillr„ Ritter, Munro, schum, wilkins. If ‘ ne ' were read we must point the
verse as containing two questions : ‘ What of Symrna and Colophon? Are they
greater or less than their repute? ’ It is doubtful however (apart from external
evidence for the reading) whether the intrusion of a fresh question does not
injure the sense. The meaning of the four times repeated ‘quid [tibi visa]?' is
given in the three alternative questions of VV. 4, 5, 6. Horace's interest is not in the
new light which a traveller has to throw on places he has visited, but in the
traveller's own frame of mind ε ‘ Has he had the good sense to feel that home was
the best place after all? or has he, for one or another of a traveller's reasonS, been
fascinated by any of them ⁴? ' If we read ‘ ve,' some uncertainty is left as to the punc-
tuation and sense. (1) It would be possible (if the consideration just alleged does
not bar it> still to put the two notes of interrogation and translate, not ‘ are they
