HORATII ARS POETICA.

Dignis carminibus narrari cena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decentem.
Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit,
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore3

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri

95

Telephus et Peleus. cum pauper et exsul uterque
Proicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba,
Si curat cor spectantis tetigisse querela.
Non satis est pulchra esse po'e'mata3 dulcia sunto,

Et quocunque volent animum auditoris agunto.

Ut ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adsunt

90. privatis carminibus, ‘strains of
common life‚⁷ opposed to tragedy which
‘ regum Facta canit' Sat. 1. 10. 42.

92. decentem z the reading of V
and of the Berne MS„ rightly de-
fended by Bentley. Orelli. SchutZ, and
Keller keep ‘ decenter.' The line sums
up what is being said in a maxim ; cp.
v. 31.

93. et answers to ‘et’ v. 95; both
comedy and tragedy depart on occasions
from their usual tone.

94. Chremes: ‘ a Chremes‚' i. e. an
angry father, on the comic stage, as in the
following lines ‘ a Telephus and Peleus,'
i. e. a tragic hero in distress. The refer-
ence is very probably to Terence's He-
autontimorumenos, although Chremes'
shortlived abuse of his son Clitipho in
the play scarcely answers to the words
‘tumido delitigat ore.’ Cp. Sat. 1. 4.
4⁸3. There is full reference to a definite
scene in the Eunuchus in Sat. 2. 3. 259 f.
On the other hand the Chremes os Epod.
2. 33 must belong to some unknown
drama.

95. tragicus, ‘in tragedy' ; as ‘ Davus
comicus ' Sat. 2. 5. 91.

plerumque z to be explained by
what was said in the last note —
namely‚ that he means not only Tele—
phus and Peleus but other characters in
their situation: ‘ personas ipsas potius
quam certas quasdam fabulas respexit'
Orelli.

sermone pedestri : see on Od. 2. 1 2.
9, and Sat. 2. 6. 17.

96. Telephus: Epod. 17. 8; Aris—
tophanes laughs at Euripides (Ach. 428
f.) sor the sorry guise in which he dis-
played Telephus when he went to beg

of the Greeks that Achilles might cure
him of his wound.

Peleus was exiled from Aegina sor
killing his half brother Phocus, Ov. Met.
11. 268 f. ‘ fraterno sanguine sontem Ex—
pulsumque domo patria Trachinia tellus
Accipit,’ etc.

97. proicit ampullas, ‘ throws aside
his paint—pots'; see on the use of the
verb ‘ampullari' Epp. 1. 3. 14.

sesquipedalia, ‘a foot and a half
long.⁷ Cp. Crates (Meineke. fr. 2) ἔπη
τριπήχη-

98. This line points the connection.
This raising of the tone in comedy and
dropping it in tragedy are not arbitrary,
they are due to the higher law that
language must be true to the feeling
which is to be represented, and so to be
inspired in the spectator.

For tetigisse see on Od. 3. 4. 52.

99. pulchra . . . dulcia: the one
adj. of beauty, the other of charm3 the
one of satisfying the taste, the other of
touching the feelings. Orelli points out
that a similardistinction‚though in amore
limiied sphere, is drawn by Dionysius
Halicarn. (de Comp. 19) ‘between τὸ
καλόν and τὸ ἡδύ, where he says that
the diction of Thucydides possesses the
first quality, that of Xenophon the
second, that of Herodotus unites the
two.

101 f. As Orelli says ‘exponit vim
συμπαθείαςῖ Cp. Arist. Rhet. 3. 7. 5
συνομοιοπαθεῖὑ ἀκούων ἀεὶ τῷ παθητικῶς
λέγοντι.

101. adsunt=‘praesto sunt‚' ‘wait
on‚' are ready to sympathize with. There
is no need with Orelli to alter to ‘ ad-
flent.’
