LIB. I.

SAT. 1. 27

Frontibus adversis componere: non ego avarum
Quum veto te fieri vappam iubeo ac nebulonem.

Est inter Tanain quiddam socerumque Viselli.

105

{Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,
*Quos ultr-a citraque nequit consistere rectum.
Illuc unde abii redeo, qui nemo, ut avarus,

Se probet, ac potius laudet diversa sequentes,

Quodque aliena capella gerat distentius uber

110

Tabescat, neque se maiori pauperiorum

Turbae comparet, hunc atque hunc superare laboret.
Sic festinanti semper locupletior obstat,

Ut, cum carceribus missos rapit ungula currus,

103. frontibus adversis, a filling out
of the metaphor of‘ componere,' though
in terms which suggest rather a bull-
fight, Virg. Aen. 12. 716. Lucretius uses
the phrase of two clouds meeting, 6.
116.

componere is used of getting up a
fight between two gladiators: cp. Sat.
1. 7. 20. Palmer prefers to make it=
‘ reconcile.’

104. fieri belongs to both clauses.

vappam ae nebulonem. Horace
puts the two names together again in
Sat. 1. 2. 12. ‘Vappa' is properly
wine which had lost its flavour: so Sat.
1. 5. 16, 2. 3. 144. Catullus 28. 5 ap-
plies it in special opposition to the name
‘Frugi’ (see Ellis in loco) to a man
whose character is gone. ‘ Nebulo' is
a word of Lucilius : 14. 20 ‘ luci-
sugus nebulo'; 20. 9 ‘ nugator ac
nebulo? In the first passage he seems
to be alluding to its etymology, ‘a
skulker?

105. According to the Scholiasts
Horace has put real names (Tanais
being a freedman of Maecenas> to a
coarse Greek proverb which expresses
the alternative of excess and defect.

106. est modus in rebus, i. e. ‘in
omnibus rebus,’ ‘modus,' ‘ measure‚'
‘ moderation,’ the Greek μέτριον, μεσότης.
Horace perhaps has in mind the verse
of Lucilius quoted on v. 92, where
‘modus’ and ‘ finis' are brought toge-
ther. As the ‘denique’ seems to show
he is returning to what he said there.

108. quj nemo, ut. This was the
reading of V. There is in favour of it
(1) that this is ‘the point from which

he started,’ ‘Qui fit Maecenas‚' etc. The
following words ‘laudet diversa se-
quentes’ show that we are going back
to the very question propounded in vv.
1, 23 (2) that the accidental omission
of ‘qui’ will explain ‘nemo 111,Ί and
(for the purpose of avoiding the hiatus)
‘nemon ut.’ It is hard to see how
‘qui' can have arisen from either of
the other readings. The difficulty lies
in explaining ‘ut avarus.' Can it mean
‘ Why as the hoarder [is not] so no one
is satisfied with himself⁷P Or does the
phrase ‘se probet‚' which alone does
not corne from vv. 1, 2, lead us back to
the special story of the miser at Athens,
v. 66 ‘at mihi plaudo’: ‘why no one
imitates the miser in the story Ῥ Prof.
Palmer proposes to understand ‘fiat'
between ‘qui ' and ‘ut,' ‘how it comes
that‚' taking ‘nemo avarus’ together,
but he gives no example of such an
ellipsis.

112. hune atque hune, ‘one and
then another.'

113. sie with ‘festinanti’3 one who
is started on this race always finds a
richer man than himself to compare
himself with, just as in a chariot-race
each driver’s eyes are set on the one
before him, not on those he has passed.

114. The resemblance of the com—
mencement ‘Ut cum carceribus‚' fol-
lowed by ‘ Instat equis auriga‚' to Virg.
G. 1. 512 foll. ‘ Ut eum carceribus sese
effudere quadrigae . . . Fertur equis
auriga’ is too great to be accidental.
XVhether any argument can be drawn
from this as to the date of either poem
may be doubted. See Prof. Sellas,
