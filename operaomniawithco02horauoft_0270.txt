258 HORATII EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE IX.

TO TIBERIUS.

‘ SEPTIMIUS presses me to introduce him to you. He knows, you see, better, and
rates higher, than I do, my influence with you. Ι would fain have excused myself;
but having to choose between the appearance to him of a selfish mock-modesty
or to you of a brazen impudence, Ι chose the less fault. If you can approve of
boldness assumed in a friend's behals, admit Septimius to your circle and believe
all good things of him)

This Epistle is addressed to the young Tiberius himself. The tact and grace
of it have commanded universal admiration.

Septimius is doubtless the friend of Od. 2. 6 ‘Septimi Gades aditure mecum.’
See introd. to that Ode and cp. note on Epp. 1. 3. 9 for the apparently erroneous
identification of him by the Comm. Cruq. with the Titius of that Epistle.

SEPTIMIUS‚ Claudi, nimirum intelligit unus

Quanti me facias. Nam cum rogat et prece cogit

Scilicet ut tibi se laudare et tradere coner,

Dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis,

Munere cum fungi propioris censet amici, 5
Quid possim videt ac novit me valdius ipso.

Multa quidem dixi cur excusatus abirem3

Sed timui mea ne finxisse minora putarer,

Dissimulator opis propriae, mihi commodus uni.

Sic ego maioris fugiens opprobria culpae 10
Frontis ad urbanae descendi praemia. Quodsi
