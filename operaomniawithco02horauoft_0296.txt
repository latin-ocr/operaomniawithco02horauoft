282 HORATII EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE XV.

TO VALA.

THIS is one os the Epistles which carry on their face more of the occasion and
purpose ofa true letter. Horace writes to Vala as one well acquainted with the
coast in that part of Italy to ask about Velia and Salernum as winter resorts ; ex-
plaining by the way why he is not going as usual to Baiae: ‘It is not my fault,
but that of Antonius Musa, who has put me on the cold water treatment: yet, no
doubt, Ι am looked upon at Baiae as a traitor and renega<le.' The questions
which he asks <with this interpolated explanation in vv. 2-13) last until v. 25.
The remainder of the Epistle is occupied with an ironical apology sor the incon-
sistency between these particular enquiries as to the luxuries to be had at the
southern watering-plaees and the tone of contented Stoicism with which his friends
at this time were familiar. ‘You see after all I am like Maenius, a philosopher
when Ι must be so, a bon—vivant when Ι can’ (vv. 26—46). This turn of the
Epistle has been prepared for by the parenthesis (vv. 16—21)‚ in which he explains
that he asks about the water rather than the wine of the country, not that he means
to drink water, but because, although at home at his farm he can drink anything,
at the seaside he wants something better than ‘vin du pays!

Missing the connection of thought, some of the best MSS. divide the Epistle, be—
ginning a new one at v. 26 (see introd. to Ode 1. 7).

Os the Vala of this Epistle, called Numonius Vala in the heading given in several
MSS„ we know nothing certainly. The name os Q. Numonius Vala has been
found in an inscription *4‘ at Paestum—half-way, that is, between Salernum and Velia.
We gather srom the Epis-tle that he was well acquainted with both places, and from
v. 46, probably, that he had a handsome country house in the neighbourhood.
One Numonius Vala met an inglorious death in the German campaign of ΑΛ). 9
under Varus, but there is nothing to identify the two.

We may note in the Epistle the recurrence to the topic of his own inconsistency,
especially in respect of his love of simplicity and pretensions to philosophy. He is
conscious that such charges are made against him, and he meets them sometimes
with denial, sometimes with playsul and half-ironical confessions. We must not
be misled by these, or suppose that he really attributes to himself the same motives
as to Maenius. His true answer is little more than ‘there is a time for every-
thing.' In the last Epistle he preaehed that inconsistency was sometimes the truest
c0n51stency.

1. hiems: for Horace's practice of as Salernum (now Salerno) is some
spending the autumn at his farm and twenty—five miles north of it. The

Veliae, the Greek Ἐλέα, on the coast 2. qualis via, ‘ what the road is like ’ς
some twenty-five miles south of Paestum, a question always of interest in Horace.
