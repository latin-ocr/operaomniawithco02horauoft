Herculis ad postem fixis latet abditus agro, 5.
Ne populum extrema toties exoret arena.

Est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet aurem:

‘ Solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne <

Peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat?

Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono, · 10
Quid verum atque decens, curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum ;
Condo et compono quae mox depromere possim. ·’

Ac ne forte roges quo me duce, quo lare tuter,

proof is alleged of any inore specific
relation between gladiators and the
worship of Hercules beyond Vitruvius'
injunction (1. 7), quoted by Orelli, that
temples of Hercules should be built near
gymnasia, amphitheatres, or (as at Rome)
the Circus.

5. abditus: Od. 3. 4. 38, of retired
veterans. ‘abdidit oppidis.’ But here
with ‘latet' there is a stronger sense of
hiding; ‘ he hides himself out of sight in
the country.' So Cicero of his retire-
ment from public life, de Off. 3.1. 3
‘abdimus nos quantum licet et soli
sumus.’

6. The idea seems to be that if he
were tempted or forced back into the
arena he would have each time again
to win his discharge by appeal to the
people. He wishes to have done with
it once sor all.

extrema arena, ‘from the arena's
edge,’ i. e. approaching the parapet
round the arena behind which the most
distinguished spectators sat. The ex—
planation given of populum exoret, is
that of Acron, who vouches sor the fact
that gladiators obtained their ‘ rudis ' in
this way. Some editors interpret it of
his being defeated and having to appeal
for his life; cp. Juv. S. 3. 36 ‘ verso pol-
lice volgus Quem iubet occidunt popu-
lariter.' It is more difficult however
to give in this way a satisfactory mean-
ing to toties; aud the chance of end—
ing with a breakdown seems to be kept
as a last consideration for the following
verses and a different similitude.

7. est, mjhi: as Orelli interprets,
an inward monitor. Cp. with him
Pers. S. 5. 96 ‘Stat contra ratio et se-
cretam garrit in aurem Ne liceat facere,¹
etc.

purgatam. It is a double statement;
that there is such a monitor and that
the poet's ear is open to listen. Cp.

‘ auriculae collecta sorde dolentes ’ Epp.
1 2. 53.

8. mature sanus,
and loose‚’ etc.

9. ilia ducat: the tired horse which
stands ‘straining his flanks' in the effort
to get breath.

10. et cetera ludicra,
other playthings.' Cp. Epp. 2. 2. 55
‘ Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes:
Eripuere iocos, Venerem. convivia, lu-
dum; Tendunt extorquere poemata.’

pono, sc. ‘depono.'

11. quid verum, sc. ‘ sit? ‘ Verum'
and ‘decens' are two descriptions of
moral right, both from philosophical
language of the day. For ⁴ verum' in
the sense of true to a moral standard
cp. Sat. 2. 3. 208, 312; Epp. 1. 7. 98,
1. 12. 23; Virg. Aen. 12. 694·me verius
unum Pro vobis foedus luere.’

decens, acc. to Ciceio's definition
gOff. Ι. 27. 933 the equivalent of‘hones-
tuin ' and of the Greek πρέπον.

omnis in hoc sum: Sat. 1. 9. 2
‘totus in illis?

12. condo, of storing material.

compono, of setting it in order.

depromere, a continuation of the
metaphor, ‘to bring out of the store ' for
use. He is accumulating or digesting
principles of practica] philosophy sor his
own guidance.

13. ne roges, ‘to forestall your ask-
ing '; the negative purpose of the state-
ment made in v. 14 foll. See on Od.
1. 33.1 andcp. Epp.1 16.‚1 1 19. 26,
2. 1. 208.

quo duee: ‘dux' was used both of a
leader in war and of the chief of a
philosophical school. See Munro on
Luer. 1. 638.

lare, a variation of the frequent use
of ‘ familia’ and ⁴ doinus ¹ (Od. 1. 29. 14)
for such a school.
