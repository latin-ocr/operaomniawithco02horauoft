HORATII SATIRARUM

Stultitiae nihilum metuenda timentis, ut ignes,
Ut rupes fluviosque in campo obstare queratur-3 55
Alterum et huic varum et nihilo sapientius ignes

Pei· medios fluviosque ruentis.

Clamet amica

Mater, honesta soror, cum cognatis pater, uxor:

‘ Hic fossa est ingens, hic rupes maxima, serval’

Non magis audierit quam Fufius ebrius olim, 60
Cum Ilionam edormit, Catienis mille ducentis,

‘Mater‚ te appello!’ clamantibus.

Huic ego volgus

Errori similem cunctum insanire docebo.

53-62. ‘It is soolish to sear where
there is nothing to sear. as you did when
you would have killed yourself to avoid
the ridicule of men as foolish as your-
self; but it is equally foolish to ignore
real obstacles and dangers.'

54. nihilum, as an adv. with ‘me-

timentis. It is difficult to say whether
this agrees with ‘stultitiae’ a personal
subj. being supplied for ⁴ queratur} or
whether the masc. gen. should be under-
stood with it.

56. varum, a coloured equivalent to
‘dissimiles and taking the sarne con-
struction (dativel 3 by the word ‘ varum '
Horace implies that both are deformi-
ties. It is like two legs, equally crooked‚
though they are bent in different direc-
tions.

ignes. For the metaphorical use of
‘ignes‚’ ‘rupes‚' etc. cp. Sat. 1. 1. 39,
Epp. 1. 1. 46, I-Ie is speaking of the

headlong pursuit of the objects of de· ·

srre.

57. clamet. For the omission of
any conditional or concessive particle
see on Sat. 1. 1. 45, Epp. 1. 1. 28.

amica mater, ‘melius est sic accipi,
ut sit ex Graeco tractum, φίλη μήτηρ,
quarn per se, amica, per se deinde, mater,
quia mentionem uxoris facit in sequen-
tibus‘ Porph. Eaeh of the first two
relations has an epithet indicating its
special claim on him—‘ honesta ⁷=‘ de-
serving respect‘ 3 ‘ cum cognatis’ serves
the same purpose with the last two,

‘with all his kith and kin? For Horace s

Ilione of Pacuvius⁷ a play to which Cicero
refers more than once, and from which
he quotes the same words (Tusc. Disp.
1. 44. 106, Acad. 2. 27. 88, pro Sest. 59.
1 26). Ilione, the daughter of Priam and
the wife of Polymnestor, had in this ver-
sion of the story substituted her brother
Polydorus (see Virg. Aen. 3. 49 follJ
for her son Deiphilus. Deiphilus has
been killed under this error by his
father, and his shade rises and calls on
his mother Ilione, ‘ Mater, te appello, quae
curam somno suspensam levas⁷ Neque
te mei miseret, surge et repete natum.'
Fufius, who is acting the part of Ilione,
seems to have gone really to sleep,
and not to have been waked by the
appeals of Catienus who acted Dei-
hilus.

p 61. cum . . . edm-mit, as ‘ cum prae-
cipitat ' inf. v, 277, and as the common
use of ‘dum' with the pres. of a past
action.

Ilionam edormit = acts to the full,
over-acts, the part of the sleeping
Ilione.

mille ducentis z perhaps as the double
of ‘ sescenti ’ (as that is of ⁴ trecenti‚⁷ cp.
Od. 2. 14. 5) for an indefinitely large
number. ‘ Sleep5‚ though not one Ca-
tienus but twelve hundred shout at him !'
The picture is of the audience entering
into the joke and taking up Catienus’
appeal in the vain endeavour to waken
Fufius.

62. huie errori.
back to‘ errorg
astray' is the second alternative of vv.

‘Errori' takes us

way of varying a list by the use of ³53— —62‚ viz. the pursuit of ends and in-

‘cum' see below v. 229, and ep Sat.
1. 10. 85, Epp. 1. 6. 17, 2. 1. 5, A. P.
1420. The allusion is to an incident
which occurred in the aeting of the

dulgence of passions without heed of
the difficulties and dangers.

accus. after ‘insanire,’ as in Epp. 1. 1.
