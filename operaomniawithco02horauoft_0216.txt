HORATII SATIRARUM

Ne male conditum ius apponatur, ut omnes

Praecincti recte pueri comptique ministrent! 70
Adde hos praeterea casuS, aulaea ruant si

Ut mod03 si patinam pede lapsus frangat agaso.

Sed convivatoris uti ducis ingenium res

Adversae nudare solent, celare secundae.’'

Nasidienus ad haec: “Tibi di quaecunque preceris 75

Commoda dent!
Et soleas poscit.

Ita vir bonus es convivaque comis.’‘
Tum in lecto quoque videres

Stridere secreta divisos aure susurros.³
Nullos his mallem ludos spectasse; sed illa

Redde age quae deinceps risisti.

‘Vibidius dum 80

Quaerit de pueris num sit quoque fracta lagena,

Quod sibi poscenti non dantur pocula, dumque

Ridetur fictis rerum Balatrone secundo,

Nasidiene, redis mutatae frontis, ut arte

Emendaturus fortunam; deinde secuti 85
Mazonomo pueri magno discerpta ferentes

Membra gruis sparsi sale multo, non sine farre3

could in that case hardly be obtuse
enough to take the speech as kindly
meant. The ‘sneer' of Balatro con-
sists in the profession ofsympathy which
he does not feel, and in his encourage—
ment of the host to new efforts which
he expects to be as ludicrous in their
results as the former ones.

69. ne male conditum refers to
Nasidienus’ account of the thought he
has bestowed on the sance, v. 45 foll„ as
the next verse refers to the actual dress
of the waiters, v. 10.

72. ut modo, ‘as they did just now.’

agaso, lit. a stable-boy. Here prob-
ably and in Pers. 5. 76 for a clownish
slave. We are not to think with Heind.
that Nasidienus has actually brought
his groom in to wait.

77. soleas: Sat. 1. 3. 128, Epp. 1.
13. 15; slippers worn indoors. The
guests lay with their feet bare (cp. the
story in St. Luke vii. 37, 38). When
they moved they resumed the ‘ soleae?
Plaut. Truc. 2. 4. 12 ‘ cedo soleas mihi,'
when Dinarchus rises from table, ibid.
16, when he sits down again, ‘deme
soleas.' Cp. Mostell. 2. 1. 37 with
Ramsay’s note.

78. Notice the imitation of whisper-
ing in the accumulated sibilants.

81. quoque, with the sentence, ‘ whe-
ther the wine-jar had been broken as
well,’ i. e. besides the accident of the
awning.

83. fietis rerum: see on Sat. 2. 2.
25 ‘ vanis rerum ’; ‘ pretended jestS‚’ to
conceal the fact that they were really
laughing at their host and his shifts.

seeundo, ‘strenue adiuvante‚' the
metaphor from ‘vento secundo‚’ ‘Balatro
filling our sails.’

84. Nasidiene. The vocative is
mock heroic, after Homer's Οὐδέ σεθεν,
Μενέλαε, θεοῖ μάκαρες λελάθοντο, etc.

redis mutatae frontis, an extension
os the common use of the gen. of quality
with ‘ sum ’; see on Sat. 1. 4. 17.

arte, from Ter. Ad. 4. 7. 23 ‘illud‚
quod cecidit forte, id arte ut corrigas.'

86. mazonomo. Properly a trencher
for serving barley - cakes (μᾶζα) on
(Athen. 4. ξ 31, p. 149). Here it is
used for a large dish on which was
collected this medley of delicacies.

87. gruis sparsi. It is noticed that
‘grus' is in all other places feminine,
‘anser’ masc. (The reading ‘albae’
