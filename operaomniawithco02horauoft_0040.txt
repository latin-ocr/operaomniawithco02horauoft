HORATII SATIRARUM

115

Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem.
Inde fit ut raro qui se vixisse beatum
Dicat, ct exacto contentus tempore vita
Cedat uti conviva satur, reperire queamus.

Iam satis est.

Ne me Crispini scrinia lippi

Compilasse putes, verbum non amplius addam.

Roman Poets virgil, ch. 5, note on p. 174.
He thinks Virgil was the copyist. For
the ‘ carceres’ see Dict. Ant. s. v. Circus.

115. illum praeteritum, ‘that other
competitor whom he has passed ε’ ‘ il—
lum‚' perhaps with some sense of con-
tempt. ‘ Extremos inter euntem,’ the
expression of his contempt, ‘ as amongst
the hindmost in the race.'

119. uti conviva satur, cp, Epp. 2.
2. 214. It is from Lucret. 3. 938 ‘ Cur
non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis Ae-
quo animoque capis securam stulte, qui-
etem ³? and ib. 959 ‘ nec opinanti mors
ad caput astitit ante Quam satur ac
plenus possis discedere re1·um.’ See
Munro on the first of these passages.
He points out that ‘verbum non arn-
plius addam ’ is a verbal echo of another
line from this passage, though the sense
is different, ‘ cur amplius addere quaeris '
v. 941. Notice that Lucretius is tracing
the unreadiness to die to the same cause
as Horace, ‘quia semper aves quod

abest, praesentia temnis.’ We have in
fact the germ of the Satire.

120. Crispini: Sat. 1. 3. 139,1.4.
14, 2. 7. 45. From these passages we
gather that he was a fluent writer
(perhaps, as the Scholiasts say, of verses)
and a Stoie, and that he had incurred
Horace's contempt3 see above on v. 14.
There is nothing to be added to this
from external sources.

scrinia : Epp. 2. 1. 113. Cylindrical
cases for rolls of papyrus It seems to
mean here ‘the cases (Crispinus is so
voluminous that he needs more than one)
which contain Crispinus' writings.’

lippi, probably in a moral sense
‘purblind't cp. Sat. Ι. 3. 25, where
it is part of a definite metaphor‚ and see
Conington on Pers. S. 1. 79. Bentley,
taking it literally, and thinking that
Horace could not ridicule in another an
infirmity which attached to himself(Sat.
1. 5. 39, Epp. 1. 1. 29), wished to read
‘ lippum.’
