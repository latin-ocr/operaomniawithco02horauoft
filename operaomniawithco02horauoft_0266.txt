70. ut libet, ‘ as you please,' a sor-
mula of careless assent3 so in v. 19. It
is frequent in Terence as Ad. 2. 2.
38.

72. dicenda tacenda, ‘ on every
topic wise and foolish '; the expression is
probably from the Greek proverbial
ῥητὰ καῖ ἄρρητα (as in Dem. de Cor.
ξ 157, Soph. O. C. 1001). Persius 4.
5 imitates the phrase, but describes the
opposite character, ‘ dicenda tacendaque
ealles‚' ‘ you know well what should be
said and what not.’

74. piscis, ‘ as a fish’ ; for the figure
cp. Sat. 2. 5. 25.

visus, sub. ‘ est.'

75. mane eliens: see on v. 68.

certus, ‘ a constant dailyffiuests

76. rura has the constr. of ‘rus '
without the preposition‚ as ‘ domos ’ has
of ‘domum ' in Liv. 22. 22 ; see Madv.

indietis Latinis. The ‘feriae La-
tinae' were ‘conceptivae,' that is. the
time of their observance was fixed for the
year by the consuls. This is the mean-
ing of ‘ indicere.' They were marked
by a ¹ iustitium‚' so that the courts being
closed, Philippus would be able to take
a short holiday. Cicero makes the
‘ feriae Latinae ' the time of the discus-
sion ‘ De Republica,' at the garden of
Scipio (De Rep. 1. 9).

comes alter, uti ne solus rusve pere-
greve Exirem.' So Sat. 2. 6. 42, Epp.

77. impositus mannis, ‘ mounted in
the pony<carriage'; Virg. Aen. 12. 736
‘conscendebat equos.’ G. 3. 358 ‘in-
vectus equis.' For ‘ mannis ' cp. Od. 3.v
27. 7, Epod. 4. 14.

arvum caelumque Sabinum . .
laudare, the delight of the townsman
at country sights and sensations; pos-
sibly also, as Orelli thinks, his ignor-
ance, for a Sabine farm would not be

valued highly. He quotes Catull. 44.

ᾗ). sibi requiem. Orelli interprets
·’ oblectationem et recreationem a foren-
sibus 11eg01ii5‚' and this is the usual
rendering; but it is doubtful whether
‘ requiem' could by itself have this
force. It is helped however by the con-
trast implied in the ‘ sibi‚' emphasized as
that is by its position both in its own
clause ‘per chiasmum' with ‘undique.'
The person whose case he thought of
was not his client but himself, even as
what he cared for was a laugh, not for
the quarter in which he sought it. Rib-
beck (followed by Seh'utz) explains it
as ‘rest from Menas’ chatter' (⁴ non
cessat laudare ⁷), but this is not Philip-
pus’ view : he is amused at the chatter,
‘ videt ridetque.'

dum . . . dum . . . dum. There is
a conversational roughness in the substi-
tution of ‘dum ' in the first two cases

sor causal clauses, in the third sor a ’ ¹ χ

gerundial one.

81. persuadet, ‘tries to persuade.'

8 3.) ex nitido, 'from a spruce towns-
man.
