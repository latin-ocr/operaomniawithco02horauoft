Per quem tot iuvenes patrio caruere sepulcro?

Et Menelaum una mecum se occidere clamans.'

old legal formula; see on Od. 3. 4. 51.
For the quantity of the last syll. os ⁴ velit '
see on Sat. 1. 4. 82. The position of
‘cur' by itsels after the fact has been
positively stated—¹ you forbid—why 2 '
—emphasizes the question. So again
Sat. 2. 9. 104.

188. quaero. V had ‘quaere,’ and
Cruquius and Bentley strongly defend
it. (If accepted it would be a parallel
for ‘io Bacche' in Sat. 1. 3. 7.) The
Schol. however distinetly recognise
‘quae1·o‚' and as against Bentley it
may be argued that the vulg. gives a
smoother and more dramatic course to
the dialogue. Agamemnon seems at
first curtly to refuse discussion. The
Stoic ironically bows acquiescence. The
king goes on to finish his sentence, and
explains that he bases his act on reason
as well as will, and that he is prepared
to argue the question. The Stoic is
delighted, but hardly able to believe
that a king means to listen to reason.

et joins the clause to rex sum, not
to the following ao.

191. An echo of Hom. 11. 1. 18
ὑμῖν μὲν θεοῖ δοῖεν . , . Ι ἐκπέρσαι Πριάμοιο
πόλιν, εὖ δ’ οἴκαδ’ ἱκέσθαι,

reducere (or ‘redducere') is the
reading os all the best MSS. It is found
with the first syllable long four times in
Lucretius. Some editors, on the advo-
cacy of Bentley, have received ‘deducere‚’
which Orelli interprets on the analogy
of ‘ decedere de provincia,’ i. e. ⁵ domum
redire?

192. consulere . . .
formula with which the consultation
os a ‘ iurisconsultus' was opened tCic.

for the counsel's advice. Part of the
humour consists in the burlesque ming-
ling of technicalities of Roman life with
Homeric echoes. It is doubted whe-
ther both verbs are meant to belong to
the Stoic, ‘to put questions and pre-
sently to assume the counsel myself and
advise you,’ or the second to Agamem—
non, ‘ shall we be allowed to have a
regular consultation, I asking and you
replying?' ‘Mox' has most force in
the first way. Cp. also Sat. 1. 9. 63
‘rogat et respondet!

193. ab Achille secundus, ‘second
to Achilles’ as Virg. Ecl. 5. 49 ‘ alter
ab illo.’ The rank of Ajax is from
Hom. Il. 2. 768 ἀνδρῶν αὖ μέγ’ ἄβατος
ἔην Τελαμώνιος Αἴας, Ι ὄφρ’ Ἀχιλεὺς μή·
νιεν“ ὁ ’γὰρ πολὺ φέρτατος ἦεν. Cp.
Soph. Aj. 1339.

194. putescit, a coarse word, but
probably due to the Homeric πύθεται
tas 11. 4. 395, Od. 1.162). The form
‘putesco' with the first syll. long is
found in the best MSS. of Lucretius, 3.
8-1.

l195. gaudeat ut, of a result so evi-
dent that it seems like a purpose. The
line is a transl. of Hom. 11. 1. 255
(though of a different matter) ἧ κεν
’γηθήσαι Πρίᾶμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες.

197, 198. The answer of Agamemnon.

197. mille ovium. Horace in every
other place prefers the constr. of ‘mille '
in the sing. as an adjective. Cicero has
both constructions.

insanus. The word falls first from
Agamemnon’s own lips, and so lcads to
the retort which gives the whole story
its relevance.
