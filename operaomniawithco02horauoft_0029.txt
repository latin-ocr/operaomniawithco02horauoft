LIBER PRIMUS.

SATIRE I.

THE FOLLY OF WISHING INSTEAD OF ENJOYING.

THIS folly is seen in its extreme form in the hoarder of money. His case, his
unreasonableness and the vanity os his excuses, are set out at length, but the Satire
begins and ends more generally. Men are always wishing for what they have not,
and so they do not enjoy what they have, and when life is over do not feel that
they have had their share.

Verses 1—12 state the difficulty generally. The world is a scene of discontent—
restlessness-every one wishing to be what he is not.

(13—41). The absurdity of this is shown by two considerations.

13-22. (a) That if you could imagine men's wishes granted, they would not make
the exchange. The wish is not a real one.

23—41. (b) That if you take the great object of wishing and motive of action,
money, every one, whatever his profession, will tell you that he seeks it sor an
end—give him an assured competence and he looks to retire. He is like the
ant storing for winter. Is he ⁴? The ant when winter comes uses its store and
ceases from work⁷ but the seeker after money never stops while there is a man

left richer than himself.

(41-107). Horace then proceeds to argue more fully with the man who accumulates
but does not use, partly directly‚ partly imagining and replying to pleas which
he may be supposed to urge for himself.

41, 42. What is the pleasure of storing, however large an amount os precious metal,
in the earth?

43, 44. ‘ If you once touch the heap it melts away.‘ But surely it is meant to be
touched.

45-50. The pleasure is measured not by the size of the store but by the capacity of
enjoyment. However full your barns are you can’t eat more than Ι can.

51. ‘ It is pleasant to feel that you are drawing from a large store.‘

52—60. It makes no difference if the amount we draw is the same. Nay, it does
make a difference in another way. I prefer the clear and quiet little spring to
the dangerous and turbid river.

61, 62. ‘ Where are we to stop? A man is estimated by his possessions.'

63—67. It is useless arguing——the miser is so wrapt in his sels-esteem. If the people
hiss him he will applaud himself.

68—79. You are like Tantalus, thirsting amid water. Money has definite uses——
you get none ofits pleasures—all its pains.

80-83. ‘ At least money secures help in sickness.'

84—91. You are alienating the love ready formed for you, and which you might so
easily retain.
