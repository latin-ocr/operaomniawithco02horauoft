LIB. ΙΙ.

SAT. 8. 205

Pinguibus et ficis pastum iecur anseris albae

Et leporum avulsos, ut multo suavius, armoS,

Quam si cum lumbis quis edit; turn pectore adusto 90
Vidimus et merulas poni et sine clune palumbes,

Suaves res, si non causas narraret earum et

Naturas dominus; quern nos sic fugimus ulti,

Ut nihil omnino gustaremus, velut illis

Canidia afflasset peior serpentibus Afris.³ 95

here is that of V.) It is very pos—
sibly intended to indicate that Nasi-
dienus called attention to the sex of
the birds, ep. v. 43 ; so he spoke of the
diet on which the goose had been fat-
tened, os its colour, of the part ehosen
of the hare. See on this last Sat. 2.

90. edit: subj. as Epod. 3. 3.

pectore adusto (see above v. 68).
This, as‘ sine clune,' seems to have been
a drawbaek or peculiarity. In spite of
these Fundanius says the dishes were
not bad if the host would have let them
be eaten in peace without his lectures
upon them.

91. vidimus, as v. 94 shows, em-
phatic : ‘ we saw but did not tastess

92. causas, naturas ε words that sug-
gest a philosophy of the table. ‘ Rerum

czmsas' Virg. G. 2. 450, ‘rerum na-
turam’ Luer. 1. 21, etc. Cp. the similar
play in Sat. 2. 4.

95. peior serpentibus. For the
poisonousness of the serpent's breath
the edd. quote Colum. 8. 5. 18 ‘ca-
vendum ne a serpentibus afflentur [pulli]
quorum odor tam pestilens est ut in-
terimat universos.'

Afris: ⁴ Mauris anguibus ' Od. 3. 10.
18. For Canidia as a witch see introd.
to Epod. 5 and 17, Sat. 1. S. She is
introduced here as a sort of restani, a
literary reminiscenee ¹&the words are still
in Fundanius' mouth, but he is made
in effect to say ‘ Ι am speaking Horaee’s
feelings ’)‚ like the ⁶ Tityre, te patulae‚'
which ends Virgil’s Eel. 10 as an echo
of the ‘Tityre‚ tu patulae’ of Ecl. 1. 1.
