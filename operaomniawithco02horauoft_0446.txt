HORATII ARs POETICA.

Aut fanaticus error et iracunda Diana,

nical one, which Celsus explains (3. 24)
by the fact that the patient was treated
like a king, ordered luxuries and amuse-
ments, everything ‘per quae mens ex—
hilaretur.'

454. fanaticus: not probably in its
original sense, as though he were dis-
tinguishing the frenzy of the votaries of
Cybele or Bellona <‘fanaticus oestro
Percussus, Bellona, tuo ' Juv. S. 4. 123),
from the frenzy of the ‘ moonstruck.⁷

457. sublimis, ‘ head-in—air ' ; 566 on
Epp. 2.1. 165, and above v. 165. Cp.
also Od. 1. Ι. 36, though there it is not
meant as earicature.

458. Cp. the form of madness de-
scribed in Sat. 2. 3. 56-60. There is a
story in Plat. Theaetet. p. 174 of
Thales, in a fit 01 philosophical abstrac-
tion, falling into a well.

459. succurrite: cp. the cry of the
lame beggar, Epp. Ι. 17. 61.

longum: like Homer's μακρὸν ‹iffi-rena,
so as to make the voice travel far.

461. si curet quis: the collocation
01ζ curet' gives it emphasis and so
points the connection with v. 4603‘ if
any one does care ’etc.

462. prudens: knowing what he
was about.

proiecerit: the MSS. are divided
between this and ‘ deiecerit,' which K.
and H. give.

463. Siculi poetae: Empedocles of
Agrigentum in Sicily; Epp. 1. 12. 20.

464. deus immortalis haberi: a
verse of his is quoted, χαίρετ’, ἐγὼ δ’
ὔμμιν θεὸς ἄμβροτος, οὐκέτι θνητός.

dicam, Siculique poetae
465
Sit ius liceatque perire poetis:
465. dum eupit. See on Epp.1. 18. 8.

ardentem frigidus : the verbal con-
trast, common in some poets even in
serious passages (as in Sophocles, e. g.
Oed. Col. 621 ιν’ οὑμὸς εὕδων icat κεκρυμ-
μένος νέκυς Ι ψυχρός ποτ’ αὐτῶν θερμὸν
αἷμα πίεται), 15 11616 11163111 111 jest. The
meaning of‘ frigidus' is less certain.
Too much meaning must never be
looked sor in such contrasts. The
Scholiasts refer it to a doctrine 01 1115 own,
that coldness of blood near the heart
was the cause 01 stupidity so that it is
as they say equiv alent to‘ stultus.³ See
Conington on Virg G. 2 484‘ Frigidus
obstiteiit circum piaecordia sanguis'
This is however to read too much into
the words. Others take it for‘ in cold
blood,' an unsupported sense of ‘fri-
gidus? Diintzer thinks it means merely
‘one cold day,’ ‘to warm himself‚⁷ and
Seh'utz comes to the same conclusion.

466. sit ius. From here to the end
is a series 01 ironieal suggestions which
Horace represents himself as addressing
to one and another who would rescue
the poet. ‘You should never save a
man against his will. 1t is quite use—
less, he is bent on gaining fame at least
by his death. This visitation of verse-
writing may be the punishment for some
mysterious crime. At any rate he is
mad, and wants to recite, and you may
as well sace a bear eseaped from his
eage. If he catches you he will stick
to you like a leech till he has drained
your blood.'

467. idem facit occidenti: the
