LIB. I.

EPIST. 14.

Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum. 10
Cui placet alterius, sua nimirum est odio sors.

Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique:

In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea vilicus optas3 15
Me constare mihi scis, et discedere tristem

Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.

Non eadem miramur3 eo disconvenit inter

Meque et te: nam quae deserta et inhospita tesqua
Credis, amoena vocat mecum qui sentit, et odit 20

Quae tu pulchra putas.

Fornix tibi et uncta popina

Incutiunt urbis desiderium, video, et quod
Angulus iste feret piper et thus ocius uva,
Nec vicina subest vinum praebere taberna
Quae possit tibi, nec meretrix tibicina, cuius 25

11. nimirum, ‘of course.' ‘ The phi-
losophica] account of the matter is per-
fectly clear. We are both “ stulti '' ; the
fault does not lie in the place.' Horace
puts himself on a level with the bailiff,
but proceeds immediately to point out
the difference between them.

13. Cp. Od. 2. 16. 19.

animus : cp. v. 4. This is one of the
‘ spinae.'

14. mediastinus, ‘a common drudge.’
The Scholiasts made it a hybrid word,
as though from ‘medius ’ and ἄστυ
(‘ astu’ is found in Terence, etc.) in
order to find in it the idea of ‘in the
city ' which the place seemed to require
—but the word does not convey this in
itself. In Lucilius 15. 30 it is used of a
‘ vilicus.’ Here the coutrast with ‘ vili-
cus’ and the nature of the two wishes
give the necessary sense.

tacita, ‘ which you did not dare
utter.y

16. See note on Epp. 1. 8. 12.

17. invisa negotia: cp. the picture
in Sat. 2. 6. 20—59.

18. non eadem miramur, ‘ we have
different ideals.’ See the use of ‘ mirari ’
in Epp. Ι. 6.

disconvenit z Epp. Ι. 1. 99. It is
here impersonal.

19. inhospita tesqua. A quotation
from Lucilius (2. 315 ; ‘ tesqua’ is inter-
preted by l'orph. ‘ loca aspera et silves-

tria‚' by Acr. ‘loca deserta ac difficilia,'
and said by the latter to have been a
Sabine word.

20. amoena vocat: ‘Hae latebrae
dulces, etiam, si credis, amoenae‚’ os his
farm, Epp. 1. 16. 15.

21. uncta. It is doubtful whether
this means ‘greasy,' as in Sat. 2. 4. 78
(‘rnanus'') and 2. 2. 68 <ζ aqua ')—or
‘ savoury‚' as in Epp. 1. 15. 44, A. P.

desire. It is used generally of terror
and other painful emotious; see on Sat.
2. 1. .

‘I read your motives'3 so Sat. Ι. 9. 15,
2. 2. 35.

et quod, ‘ and the fact that ' 3
further subjects to ‘ incutiunt!

23. angulus iste. 'l'he words seem
to be an imagined quotation of what
the ‘vilicus’ himself has said: and
either ‘angulus' is used here in a de-
preciatory sense (contrast Ocl. 2. 6. 14),
‘this out-of-the-way place‚' or else it is
an answer supposed to have been given
to Horace, ‘the corner you speak of—
some sunny corner which had been
pointed out as fit to try vines in—will
grow pepper aud spices as soon ns the
