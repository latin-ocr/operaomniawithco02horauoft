42 HORATII SATIRARUM

Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur3 optimus ille est
Qui minimis urgetur. Amicus dulcis ut aequum est
Cum mea compenset vitiis bona3 pluribus hisce
(Si modo plura mihi bona sunt) inclinet, amari

Si volet: hac lege in trutina ponetur eadem.

Qui ne tuberibus propriis offendat amicum

Postulat ignoscet verrucis illius3 aequum est

Peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus. 75
Denique, quatenus excidi penitus vitium irae

Cetera item nequeunt stultis haerentia, cur non

Ponderibus modulisque suis ratio utitur, ac res

Ut quaeque est ita suppliciis delicta coercet?

Si quis eum servum patinam qui tollere iussus 80
Semesos pisces tepidumque ligurrierit ius

In cruce suffigat, Labeone insanior inter

69. duleis, ‘indulgent⁷; inf. v. 159:
cp. Sat. 1. 4. 135.

70. eum has been taken either as a
preposition or as a conjunction. The
first seems preferable. As Orelli truly
says, ‘ compensare aliquid curn aliqu0,'
and ‘ compensare aliquid aliquo ⁷ do not
mean the same thing. The first is to
¹ weigh one thing against another‚’ their
comparative weight being as yet undeter-
mined. The second is to ¹ set one thing
off against others,' the weight ofthe first
thing being settled, to put something else
in the scales which will balance it. We
want here the first meaning. With the
position of ‘ cum ' cp. Ov. Fasti 5. 551
‘ Ultor ad ipse suos caelo descendit
honores‚' Madv. ξ 474. c. obs.

72. hae lege, ‘ on this condition.’

76. quatenus, Sat. 1. 1. 64, ‘since'

77. stultis, ἄφροσιν. Horace begins
his definite reference to the Stoic doc—
trines. He humorously accepts for him-
selfand the mass of mankind the title the
Stoic would give to all but the perfect
man or ‘ sapiens.' Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 32
‘insanis Et tu stultique prope omnes.‘

78. suis, ‘its own weights and mea·
sures,' such as Reason ought to have—
reasonable ones. It should not be led
away by the indiscriminating judgments
of men at large, nor should it (v. 116
foll.l endorse the philosophical folly
which makes all offences equal.

79. suppliciis coercet: both words
of some severity os punishment ; ‘pro—

portion the severity to the true offence' ;
for ‘ coercet’ cp. infr. v. 134.

80. tollere, ‘ to remove from table.'

81 . ligurrierit, the desiderative form,
‘ has been tempted to lick.’

ius is the sauce in which the fish had
been served up. Cp. Sat. 2. 4. 38, 62,
2. 8. 45 foll.

82. Labeone. The Scholiasts explain
this of M. Antistius Labeo, a ‘ iuriscon-
sultus ’ of high distinction, who is
ranked by Tacitus (Ann. 3. 75) with
Ateius Capito, and mentioned as dying
in the same year (A. D. 21), ‘ duo pacis
deeora, sed Labeo incorrupta libertate
et ob id fama celebratior.' They further
assert that it was on account of his free
speaking of Augustus that Horace thus
gibbets him ‘ut gratificetur August0.’
Bentley pointed out how improbable
this is. This Labeo would have been a
young man at any date when this Satire
could have been composed, and Horace,
even if we suppose that he would at any
time have espoused Octavianus' quarrels
in such an indecent way, was not yet
within the future emperor's circle.
XVeiehert suggested, and Estre' and Orelli
follow him, that they may be right in
the person, wrong in the reason, that
Labeo as a young man may have become
notorious for the excessive punishment
of a slave3 but it seems clear that it was
the reason and that only which suggested
to them the person. Bentley would read
‘ Labieno,’ supposing the reference to be
