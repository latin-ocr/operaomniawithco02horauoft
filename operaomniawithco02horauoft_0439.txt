HORATII ARS POETICA.

Verum operi longo fas est obrepere somnum.
erit quae si propius stes

Ut pictura poesis :

Te capiat magis, et quaedam si longius abstes.
Haec amat obscurum, volet haec sub luce videri,
Iudicis argutum quae non formidat acumen;

Haec placuit semel, haec decies repetita placebit.

365

O maior iuvenum, quamvis et voce paterna
Fingeris ad rectum et per te sapis, hoc tibi dictum
Tolle memor, certis medium et tolerabile rebus

Recte concedi.

Consultus iuris et actor
Causarum mediocris abest virtute diserti

370

Messallae nec scit quantum Cascellius Aulus,

Sed tamen in pretio est:

mediocribus esse poetis

Non homines, non di, non concessere columnae.
Ut gratas inter mensas symphonia discors

ingeniorum suorum voluptati et non-
nunquam fatigantur : cum Ciceroni dor-
mitare interim Demosthenes, Horatio
vero etiam Homerus ipse videatur;
summi enim sunt, homines tamen.'

360. verum, like the ‘verum’ of
v, 351, introduces a statement in quali—
fication of the one preceding. Here it
is an apology sor having admitted the
possibility of Homer's nodding. Horace
is labouring to make it clear that
what he is elaiming is not faultlessness.
A great poem must have its duller
parts.

361 f. ‘So‚' he goes on, ‘you must
allow for differences of scale and pur—
pose. Do not expect of “vers d⁷occa-
sion ” the kind of excellence you expect
in the poet of all time. There is one
principle—that is what all has led up

’ to—Poetry, whatever be its kind must,

of its kind, be excellent. Mediocrity is
intolerable.’

361. ut pictura poesis. Horace is
not comparing the two arts generally
(as Plutarch when he quotes Simonides
as calling painting ποιῆσιν σιωπῶσαν,
poetry ζωγραφιαν λαλοῦσαν, or as Les-
sing in the Laokoon), 1)111 m the sing le
point that in neither 15 11 fair to 351(δοὶ
the artist more than he professes to give
-a fresco is not as a miniature.

362. abstes: ‘abstare⁷ is not found
elsewhere. This led to variations in the

365. decies: sor an indefinite num-
ber, as in v. 294.

366. maior· iuvenum: the elder os
the two sons, who is evidently the per-
son for whom the Epistle is really
written.

3627. tibi adds ‘and make it your
own.

368. tolle memor: ‘ cape dicta me-
mor ¹ Virg. Aen. 6. 377.

certis=⁴ quibusdam ’3 but the word
signifies more definitely that the class
spoken of has its limits. Poetry is not
one of them.

371. Messallae: see on Sat. Ι. 10. 29.
Notice that Messalla and Cascellius an-
swer in inverse order to the lawyer and
pleader of the preceding lines.

Cascellius Aulus : for the order of
the two names see on Od. 2. 2. 3. He
was an eminent jurist, a contemporary os
Trebatius (Sat. 2. 1. 78). Hc lived into
the time of Augustus, who offered him
the consulship, which he declined.

372. mediocribus esse: for constr.
cp Sat.1.1. 19.

3733 The climax ending, παρὰ προσδο-
κίαν, 111 ζ160 umnae, ‘the booksellers'
stalls⁷ (see on Sat. 1. 4. 71), gives a
playful turn to the outburst.

374. symphonia discors· more
ambitious music than the single singer
(Epp. 2. 2. 9); but, as the ox)m01on 15
meant to emphasize if the many voices
were not in tune they were not the
better sor their number. Cic. Verr. 2.
3. 44 ⁰f›a grand feast,‘ cum symphonia
caneret.
