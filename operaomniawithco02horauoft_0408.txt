HORATII ARS POETICA.

In vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte.
Aemilium circa ludum faber imus et ungues
Exprimet et molles imitabitur aere capillos,
Infelix operis summa, quia ponere 10111111

Nesciet.

Hunc ego me, si quid componere curem, 35

Non magis esse velim quam naso vivere pravo,
Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque capillo.
Sumite materiam vestris, qui scribitis, aequam
Viribus, et versate diu, quid ferre recusent,

Quid valeant humeri.

of which we have been speaking grow
110111 the desire to give variety which
a single thing does not admit of, except
by exceeding the bounds of nature (‘ pro-
digaliter⁷ ).

31. culpae fuga. It is the doctrine
015111. 1. 2. 24 ¹ Dum vitant stulti vitia,
in contraria currunt,’ applied to literary
faults. The ‘stultitia' of a poet is
‘ arte carere.'

arte. Ritter seems right in seeing in
this word the key to vv. 32—37; ίανί,
which 11103115 remember, not merely the
power of detail, but the gift of conceiv-
ing a whole.⁷

32. Aemilium ludum. The Scho-
liasts tell 115 11131 11115 was a gladiatorial
training 5011001, 116311116 Circus Maximus,
erected by Aemilius Lepidus.

faber imus. W'hatever we may think
of Bentley's reading ‘unus‚' the case for
it is not strong enough to justify us in
printing it in the place of ‘ imus‚' which
is found in all good MSS. and was read
by all the Scholiasts. It was thought
puzzlfflg, for Aer. reports some persons
as making it 3 proper name. The ex-
planation found in all the Scholiasts is
that it is local, and means ‘the last,'
i. e. at the end of the row of shops.
Dillr. still holds this to be the true ex-
planation. Il we retain the reading it
most probably means 1116 1111111131651 arti-

3 1.15 and the uses of summusj as

‘summus vir,' ‘summus dux.' Bentley
interpreted ⁶ unus' (atter Sat. 1. 10. 42,
2. 5. 24, 2. 6. 57), ‘like no one else,'
taking it with ‘exprin1et‚’ which he
thought absolutely required some such
qualification. It is however in Horace's
way to allow the qualification os the
first clause to be gathered from ‘ molles'

Cui lecta potenter erit res, 40

in the second. It has also been proposed
(Diintzer) to take ‘ unus,’ after Cicero’s

‘unus paterfamilias' tde Orat. Ι. 29.
139), Catullus’ ‘unus caprimulgus ’ (22.
6), as ‘an average worker in brass! The
position of ‘unns ³ seems too emphatic
for this use.

‘ Unus ’ and ‘imus ’ are easy to con-
fuse, and are actually confused in MSS,
as inf. v. 152 and in Sat. 1. 4. 87. Con-
siderations of sense and propriety, there-
fore, 3ῑο of chief importance; but here
also there is room for difference of
opinion. ‘Faber’ seems to me 10 16-
quire qualification more than ‘ exprimet.'
It can hardly mean ‘some (undefined)
brass-smith'; and if 3 definite person
were meant, it would be Horace’s own
way, as Acron’s friends felt, to name
him. Whatever be the reading, it seems
to be implied that the correct represent-
ation of nails and hair was a trick of
art easily caught.

33. molles : of the soft curves of hair
represented in bronze. Cp. Virg. Aen.
6. 847 ‘ Excudent alii spirantia mollius
aera.’

34. ponere, in the artistic sense, ‘ to
represent‚' Od. 4. 8. 8.

35. hune esse: Epp. 1. 6. 40 ‘ne
fueris hic tu,’ 1. 15. 42 ‘hic ego sum.'

36. The illustration gives a playful
air, and it adds a point. Even a beauty,
if it is out of keeping, only calls attention
10 1116 countervailing defects.

37. Cp. Od. 1. 32. 11 ‘nigris oculis
nigroque Crine decorum.’

39. quid ferre recusent. Horace
represents himself in Epp. 2.1. 258 as
observing this rule himselfi‘ nec meus
audet Rem temptare pudor quam vires
ferre recusent]

40. potenter: a difficult word. Its
ordinary meaning is ‘powerfully‚' ‘ef-
