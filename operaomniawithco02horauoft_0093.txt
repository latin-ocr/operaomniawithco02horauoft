litibus omnia servent: Ipse potest fieri
Marsya causidicus‚' i. e. the statue itself
may find a voice and join in the plead-
ing. Either the face of pain on this
statue (cp. Juv. S. 9.1 ‘ Scire velim quare
toties mihi, Naevole tristis Occurris,
ceu Marsya victus ') or the uplifted
hand (ί Marsyas in foro positus . . . qui
erecta nianu‚’ etc. Servius on Virg. Aen.
4. 58), is represented satirically by
Horace as indicating displeasure at the
sight of the younger Novius, a money-
1ender, according to the Scholiasts.
For the form Marsya see on Sat. 1. 5.

day compare the account which Cicero

see on Sat. 1. 4. 133. Horace would
not approve of sleep beyond the first
hour; see Epp. 1. 17. 6, 1. 18. 34. On

composing in the early morning, Epp.

post hanc vagor. He started some-
times earlier, for in Sat. 1. 9. 35 he has
been afoot for some time at the end of
the third hour.

aut, ego lecto (pass. part„ not fre-
quentative verb as Porph. took it) to be
connected with what follows—‘ I stroll,
or when I have read or written for the
amusement of my quiet hours, I anoint

¹ myself‚’ i.e. prepare for exercise. ‘ Lecto,
1 etc.’ repeats, with explanation, the pre-
: vious ‘ad quartam ’ ‘ post hanc': ‘ ego’
: is due to the fact that he is calling
;· special attention to the freedom and
ῑ variety of his day.

after either reading or writing etc.' The
list of occupations is then ‘iaceo‚'
‘ vagor,⁷ ‘unguor,’ but is there time
before the sun is hot for both the stroll
and the game of ball ’ἓ

124. fraudatis, the lamps were
stinted or robbed. The using of bad
oil is a form of petty parsimony familiar
in Latin poets, Sat. 2. 2. 59, 2. 3.
125, 2. 4. 503 Juv. S. 5. 87 soll„ where
notice ‘ olebit lanternam.’

1 26. lusum trigonem, ‘ the game of
three‚' a game of ball. The word
‘trigon ’ is found elsewhere only in
Martial; there as a subst. denoting
either the game (4. 19. 5 ‘tepidum
trigona‚' 7. 72. 9 ‘trigone nudo‚’ i.e.
which men stripped to play3 cp. Horace's
‘ unguor ’) or the ball (ib. 12. 85. 3 ⁶ cap-
tabit tepidum dextra laevaque trigo-
rem’). Horace speaks in Sat. 2. 6. 49
of playing (ball) in the Campus, on
which the Comm. Cruq. annotateS, ‘ sole-
bant Romani in Campo Martio ludere
pila trigonali.' Bentley himself sug-
gested altering ‘ lusum’ into ‘nudum,’
to make it correspond with Mart. 7.
72. 9. Munro, thinking ‘trigon’ was
the ball itself‚ would either take ⁵ lusum ’
as a participle=‘ elusum‚' ‘cheated‚’
‘ left in the lurch‚' or alter it to ‘ pul-
sum.’ On the reading see Introduction,
vol. i. p. xv. All existing MSS. except
g (a Gotha Ms. of the 15th century)
have ‘ rabiosi tempora signi,' and this
was the text interpreted by all the Scho-
liasts. V (which is followed by g) had
the text as Ι have given it in accordance
with most editors since Bentley. Keller
and Holder, who consistently undervalue
the authority of V, have restored ‘rabiosi
tempora signi’ The origin of the
divergence cannot be guessed: Ritter
imagines an alteration by the poet's own
hand. ‘Rabiosi tempora signi' has been
taken both of the heat of noon‚—‘ signi ’
=‘ solis,'—-an(l of the dog days, ‘ aestivi
tempora sicca canis ’ Tibull. 1. 4. 6 ; cp.
Od. 1. 17. 17 ‘ caniculae vitabis aestus.⁷
Neither are satisfactory. The first
