HORATII SATIRARUM

Octoginta annos natus, cui stragula vestis,

Blattarurn ac tinearum epulae, putrescat in arca:

Nimirum insanus paucis videatur, eo quod 120
Maxima pars hominum morbo iactatur eodem.

Filius aut etiam haec libertus ut ebibat heres,

Dis inimice senex, custodis? Ne tibi desit?

Quantulum enim summae curtabit quisque dierum,

Ungere si caules oleo meliore caputque

¹25

Coeperis impexa foedum porrigine? Quare,

Si quidvis satis est, perluras, surrIpiS, aufers
Undique? Tun sanus? Populum si caedere saxis
Incipias servosque tuos quos aere pararis,

Insanum te omnes pueri clamentque puellae:

130

Cum laqueo uxorem interimis matremque veneno

Incolumi capite 65.

Lucilius. The apparent exactness, ‘but
one short of eighty,’ gives verisimili-
tude.

1 1 S. stragula, fem. adj. etymologically
not dissering from ¹ stramentum.' but by
usage of luxurious rugs and coverlets.

120. nimirum: Epp. 1. 9. 1; ‘no
doubt‚’ ‘ of course‚‘ a particle of irony z
this can be the only reason, but it is a
sufficient one.

121. iactatur, as ‘ calet’ and ‘ pallet’
in vv. 78. So. Avarice is a sever in
which a large part of mankind ’[055.
For ‘maxima pars ' cp. A. P. 24.

122. 123. Two questions suggesting
possible motives sor the miser’s craving,
the first evidentlyironical, and sufficiently
answered by stating it, the second re-
futed by the question in 124-126.

122. Cp. Od. 2. 14. 25 fou. ‘Absu-
met heres Caecuba dignior,' etc.

123. dis inimice: θεοῖς ἑχθρέ.

ne tibi desit, ‘for sear you should
yourself want?

124. enim: as γάρ, 50 osten, asking
for a justification of the previous words.
‘ Vt'hy, how small a sum will be each
day's deductiori from your capital 2'

125. oleo meliore. See on Sat. 1. 6.
124, 2. 2. 59.

127. si quidvis satis est, ‘if you
justify your thrift by saying that your
wants are very small.’

surripis, aufers, ‘illud clanculum,

hoc vi’ Orelli.
128. populum, etc. If you threw

Quid enirn, neque tu hoc facis Argis,

stones at passers-by, or at your own
slaves (those who are nothing to you or
those who are your own chattels)‚ you
would be hooted as a madman. Are
you sane when you murder outright
your nearest and dearest <to get their
money) Ζ

130. clamentque. For the position
of ‘que,’ see on Od. 1. 30. 6, and cp.
below, vv. 157 and 182.

132—141. These lines are perhaps best
taken by Bentley, making ‘ incolumi
capite es’ an affirmative statement,
ironically intended. ‘ Quid enim ' (see
on Sat. 1. 1. 71 imagines an objection or
hesitating assent, and proceeds to con—
firm the statement :—‘ why, you are not
at Argos (in old heroic days, and in the
land of tragedy) but at Rome, and you do
not use a sword as poor mad Orestes
did, (but some more deliberate imple-
ment of death) ⁷ z—the points being that
the differences given are no differences, or,
ifthey are, are against the modern mur-
derer, and that Orestes was allowed to
have been out of his mind. The re-
mainder (ἱ for you surely do not believe
that the Furies and the madness came
after his crime‚——they were its cause; his
after performances, when the poets recog—
nise his madness, were quite tame and
respectable') is quite in Horace's own
vein of playfully rationalizing poetical
legends, but it is also possibly (as Ritter
thinks) an imitation of the treatment of
myths by the Stoic lecturers.
