Distat enim spargas tua prodigus an neque sumptum

HORATII EPISTULARUM

Invitus facias neque plura parare labores,
Ac potius, puer ut festis Quinquatribus olim,
Exiguo gratoque fruaris tempore raptim.

Pauperies immunda domus procul absit:
Nave ferar magna an parva. ferar unus et idem.

Non agimur tumidis velis aquilone secund03
Non tamen adversis aetatem ducimus austris,
Viribus, ingenio, specie, virtute, loco, re,

Extremi primorum, extremis usque priores.

Non es avarus: abi.

195. There is a difference (though
the miser thinks there is none) between
lavish extravagance and the reasonable
view of wealth, which, as it does not
let a man grudge every penny that he
spend5‚ so does not make him toil ever
to get more, but allows him to enjoy
a holiday as well as a schoolboy.

197. Quinquatribus: properly ‘the
fifth day aster [the Ides]'; the name
given to the short spring holidays,
which began on March 19: see Mayor's
note on Juv. S. 10. 115.

olim: Sat. 1. 1. 25·

198. raptim: cp.
sionem’ Epod. 13. 3.

199—200. ‘ Provided 1 escape poverty
in the sense of squalor, 1 should be
as happy to sail in small ships as in
a big one? The last words are meta-
phorieaL and the figure is kept up in
the next two lines.

199. domus. The reading cannot
be considered certain3 ‘ domus ' is the
reading of the majority of good MSS„
and though it is not necessary it makes
good sense. Horace is thinking os the
opposite extreme to the luxurious sur-
nishlng of vv. 180 f. But several good
MsS. omit the word, leaving the line
unmetrical. Some transpose the words
‘ procul domus ’ (‘domus immunda ’ is
then in opposition to ‘pauperiess but
the sense is heavy, and Horace would
hardly deprecate ‘pauperies’ in this
absolute way). Bentley, on the au-
thority osone undated MS, would read
‘procul procul'3 but this is rightly
condemned as too rhetorical sor the
place. It is possible, as Orelli and
Dillr. suggest, that the facts point (as
in Od. 4. 6. 17) to the early loss of the
true word, its place being diversely

‘ rapiamus occa·

195
ego, utrum
200
Quid, cetera iam simul isto 205

filled, but by conjectures.

utrum . . . an: substituted for ‘sive‚¹
‘ seu,' as though the answering clause
were (as it is in sense) ‘it makes no
differenee! The only parallel quoted
is from Ov. Rem. Am. 797 ‘Daunius
an Libycis bulbus tibi missus ab oris,
An veniat Megaris, noxius omnis erit.’
It may be compared to the elliptical
use of ‘an,’ as ‘iure an iniuria' Liv.
2. 54, though possibly that is rather
a direct question ‘rightly. or was it
wronglyP‘ see Dr'ager, Hist. Syntax
2. ξ 468 A.a. α.

201. The figure of the ship is con-
tinued, though we pass from its size to
the weather it meets.

201, 202. As the last two verses were
of his wishes. so these are of the facts.
‘Though Ι do not run with bellying
sail before the wind of fortune, I yet
am not passing my lise in buffeting with
gales ot adversity.'

²03· specie: Epp. 1. 6. 49.

205. abi: properly a formula of dis-
missaL and thence as an exclamation
common in the dramatists with varying
shades of meaning, angry, playful, or
even expressive of, satisfaction. Cp.
Ter Adelph. 2 0, 564, 620, 703, 765.
Here it has the last sense, as in l. c. 564
(4 2. 25 ‘Laudo, Ctesipho, patriss‘as:
abi, virum te iudico) ‘ that w1ll do ‘so
far so good!

quid? As though the speaker has
wasted, but waited in vain, for a further
disclaimer.

cetera isto cum vitio. Cp. Sat. 2.
3.159 ‘Quid‚ si quis non sit avarus,
Continuo sanus? ' The same three pas-
sions—avarice, ambition, superstition,
are there ranged in the same position.
