HORATII SATIRARUM

pauperiem vitium et cavit nihil acrius, ut si

Forte minus locuples uno quadrante perisset

Ipse videretur sibi nequior: omnis enim res,

Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque pulchris 95
Divitiis parent; quas qui construxerit ille

Clarus erit, fortis, iustus.
Et quicquid volet.
Speravit magnae laudi fore.

92. ut, ‘so that)

93. perisset, . . . videretur. The
tenses are proper: ‘videretur‚' because
it is in strict sequence to ⁶ credidit‚' ete„
‘so that he seemed to himself a worse
man' being equivalent to ‘so that it
seemed to him that he would be a worse
man '-‘ futurus' might have been added
to ‘ nequior': ‘ perisset,’ because it stands
for ‘perierit' thrown into past time in
the orat. obl. ‘ Periret‚' which divides
the MSS„ would not be wrong; but the
plpst is more exact, as the being (or
being thought) a worse man is the sen-
tence which is imagined as following the
crime of dying a poorer one t cp. (with
Bentl.) the relation of ‘vidisset' to ‘ cre—
deret’ iu Sat. 1, 6. 79. Prof. Palmer's
criticism, that ‘ periret ’ is right because
if the man had been already dead he
would have known nothing of the mat-
ter, ties Horace to a logical point of
view which would have been strange
to him. It is like Aristotle's famous
criticism on Solon's saying that no one
should be counted happy till he was
dead (Eth. N. 1. 11). Horace would
have erred with Solon and SophocleS‚
not have been right with Aristotle.

94. nequior ε ⁴ abiectior ': ‘ quia
tanti quantum habeas sis' Sat. 1. 1.
62 rOrelliJ: but perhaps a moral sense
is felt, as it is the conclusion which he
drew from his faulty premiss that poverty
was a moral vice.

omnis enim res, etc. Stertinius
ironically adopts Staberius' premiss.

95. pulchris, a transl. of καλός; cp.
Epp. 1. 2. 30 ⁴ pulchrum fuit in medios
dormire dies‚' and Virgil's ‘pulchrumque
mori succurrit in armis‚' of types of
honour.

96. parent, ‘are the subjects of’3
wealth is ‘the sovereign. Cp. Epp. 1.

Sapiensne? Etiam3 et rex,
Hoc veluti virtute paratum

Quid simile isti
Graecus Aristippus? qui servos proicere aurum

1. 53 ‘ quaerenda pecunia primum est:
Virtus post nummos.' He inverts the
true Stoie doctrine ‘ virtuti omnia parent'
Sall. Cat. 2. 7.

construxerit, ‘raised a pile.' Cp.
Sat. 1. 1. 44 ‘quid habet pulchri con-
structus acervus?' Some good MSS.
have ‘ contraxerit.'

97. sapiensne Ρ Stertinius asks and
answers the question himself, as also
in vv. 89, 90, and below in vv. 99-102,
vv. 158 foll. Heindorf points out that
it is an imitation of the Stoic style.
quoting Cic. Paradox Ι ‘Cat0‚ perfectus
mea sententia Stoicus . . . minutis inter—
rogatiunculis quasi punctis quod pro-
posuit efficit.’ Stertinius <as Prof.
Palmer points out) is ironically invert-
ing (see on v. 96) his own true view.
Contrast Sat. 1. 3. 124, where the
⁴ sapiens ' is said to be ‘dives ’ and ‘ rex.'

etiam, ‘even s0’; the nearest equi-
valent to our ‘yes,’ as in Cicero: see
especially Acad. 4. 3² ‘aut “etiam'’
aut ‘*' non '’ respondere.'

98. hoc, sc. wealth. Here we have
Staberius’ true motive. To have pos-
sessed wealth was a proos ofvirtue‚ and,
is the fact was remembered, a security
for fame.

99. quid simile, sc. ‘secit,' not as
Orelliz‘ quam dissimile !’ The thought
though thrown into the rhetorical form of
questions is ‘ the point of view of Stabe-
rius and Aristippus is the same. Neither
is more or less mad than the other.
Neither understood the true use of
wealth.’

100. Aristippus: Epp. 1. 1.18, 1.
17. 14 soll. ; the founder of the Cyrenaic
school, the predecessors of the Epi-
cureans. The story which Horace tells
is to be found in Diog. Laert. 2. 77.
Horace lays the scene of it in Libya,
