HORATII ARS POETICA. 405

Vel quod res omnes timide gelideque ministrat,
Dilator‚ spe longus, iners, avidusque futuri,
Difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti

Se puero, castigator censorque minorum.

Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Ne forte seniles

Multa recedentes adimunt.

Mandentur iuveni partes pueroque viriles;
Semper in adiunctis aevoque morabimur aptis.
Aut agitur res in scenis aut acta refertur.

172. spe longus. Often taken (as
by Orelli) as meaning ‘ slow in hoping,‘
a rendering of Aristotle's δύσελπις Rhet.
2. 13. 14. It is questionable however, as
Bentley observed, whether the words can
bear this sense. They more naturally
mean ‘ patient in hope,' ⁶ content to hope
and wait.' They go closely with dila-
tor, being the first of three character—
istics which accompany and explain the
dilatoriness of the old <for it is paradox-
ical and needs explanation). It is the
opposite of youth, which is impatient,
ready for action, fuller of the present
than of the future. It does not follow
that Horace had not in mind Aristotle’s
δύσελπις, though he may have given
it a turn of his own. Bentley wished to
read ‘spe lentus,’ taking it in the sense
in which Orelli takes ¹ spe longus.'

avidus futuri: perhaps to be ex-
plained by Aristotle's φιλύζωοι καὶ μάλ-
ιστα ἐπὶ τῇ τελευταίᾳ ἡμέρᾳ διὰ τὸ τοῦ
ἀπόντος εἶναι τὴν ὲπθυμίαν. So Aer.
‘semper senex . . . vivere desiderat?
Bentley wished to alter to ‘ pavidus.'

173. difficilis: Sat. 2. 5. 90.

querulus: cp. Arist. l. c. ἐξ 15 ὀδυρτικοί
εἰσινκαὶ οὐκ εὐτράπελοι οὐδὲ φιλογέλοιοι.

acti se puero: ⁴ of the world as it
went when he was a boy': we are
meant to hear his own words. Cp.
Arist. l. c. ξ 12 διατελοῦσι ’γὰρ τὰ ’γενο-
μένα λέγοντες, ἀναμιμνησκόμενοι ’γὰρ

to count the years as they come, the old
as they go. Notice also that Aristotle,
in the place that Horace seems to have
had in view, tries to fix a point between
youth and age, Rhet. 2. 14. 4 ἀκμάζει τὸ
μὲν σῶμα ἀπὸ τῶν τριάκοντα ἐτῶν μέχρι
τῶν πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα, ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ περὶ
τὰ ἑνὸς δεῖν πεντήκοντα.

176—178. ne forte, etc. This is a final
sentence giving, after Horaee's manner,
the purpose of a statement (cp. Od. 4. 9.
1, Epp. 1. 1. 13, 2. 1. 208, inf. v. 406),
but whether it should be connected in
this way with the preceding statement or
the one that follows is not certain.
Bentley (without a note) punctuates for
the first and Munro follows him. ‘ All
this is to prevent your making the mis-
take of assigning,⁷ etc. In favour of
this is the parallel case of v. 406, q. v.
The rhythm is in favour of the more
common punctuation, which 1 have fol-
lowed, making ‘ morabimur' the prin—
cipal verb. In any case v. 178 sums up
in a precept the result of vv. 153—177.
Cp. the position of v. 23.

177. mandentur partes. It will be
understood that, as in v. 104, Horace is
speaking not of assigning a part to an
actor, but of fitting speeches and actions
to a character.

178. morabimur in. It is a question
what is the subject, and therefore what
is the sense, of ‘ morabimur? Is it ‘ We

ἥδονται. Horace must have thought of pects shall keep close to [a more coloured

Nestor in Homer. The common mode
of quoting the words, as though ‘ tem-
poris acti’ stood by itself for ‘of the
past,’ is doubtful as Latin, and not pos-
sible, as it leaves ‘se puero’ with no
construction.

174. minorum: Epp. 2. Ι. 84.

175. venientes. . ‚recedentem see
on Od. 2. 5. 14. The point of view
from which time is regarded changes as
we grow older. The young may be said

equivalent, as Schtitz, for ‘versabimur
in ⁷] the correct attributes of the time of
life’? or, perhaps more likely, ‘we the
audience [the “ ego et populus mecum ’'
osv. 153] shall dwell with pleasure on,v
&c.’? ep. the active use of ‘moror' in
v. 321 and its passive use in v. 223.

aevoque ; the dative with adiunctis
as well as aptis. For the place of
que see on Od. 1. 30. 6.
