HORATII EPISTULARUM

Dum redit, atque Foro nimium distare Carinas

Iam grandis natu queritur, conspexit, ut aiunt,

Cultello proprios purgantem leniter ungues.

description seems to touch the story at
several points. In the first place it
marks the contrast of the two men, the
great man who lifts the little man out
of his sphere, the busy man who is
struck with the leisureliness of the more
homely life. It serves also to explain
the forcesulness which Mena was unable
to resist, and perhaps to apologize (cp. V.
79) for Philippus' amusing himself in
such a way,——‘ he had done a good day's
work '-—it was a freak in an energetic
and honourable life. The person meant
is L. Marcius Philippus, consul in B.C.
91 , the opponent of the tribune M. Livius
Drusus Cicero characterizes him (de
Orat. 3. 1. 4) as ‘ vehemens et disertus et
imprimis sortis ad resistendum?

47. octavam horam. Forthe mean-
ing of ⁴ hora ' see on Sat. 1. 5. 23.

48. Carinae z Virg. Aen. 8. 361 ‘lautis
. . . Carinis3' a fashionable quarter where
Philippus may be supposed to have
had a house. It was on the Mons Op-
pius, the southern spur of the Esquiline,
which runs out towards the Arch of
Titus. The Sacra Via commenced in the
Carinae, and ran through the Forum.

50. adrasum. The main point is
the leisurely and contented life of the
man. It is in contras-t with the busy
and strenuous life of Philippus. He is
already shaved, the barber has gone
away. and he is sitting on at his ease in
the shade of the booth, cleaning hisnails‚
as though he had nothing else to do
ς( leniter ’ l. This eontrast with himself
is represented as the first thing that
attraets Philippus to Volteius; then the
picture of the contented‚ ordered, lise of
an ‘abnormis sapiens,‘ as described in
his messenger’s words (vv. 5 5-59)‚ then
the character of the man as shown by
his blunt refusal of his invitation (62—

64). It is possible that ‘ adrasum,' like
the whole picture, implies also that he
is not a man offashion ; cp. ‘tonsa cute,'
as a sign os rusticity, Epp. 1. 18. 7.

51. proprios: agrander or less leisure-
ly person would have left this to the
⁴ tonsor? Plaut. Aul. 2. 4. 33 ‘ Quin
ipsi pridem tonsor ungues dempserat.'

52. Demetri, a Greek slave; see on
Sat. 2. 5. 18.

non laeve, ‘ very cleverly.'

53. unde domo: Virg. Aen. 8. 114
‘ Qui genus? unde domo ? ’

54. quo patre quove patrono:
father, if he were free born; patron, if
if he were a freedman ; ‘nullo patre
natus.' Cp. A. P. 248 ‘ quibus est

ater.'

p 55. Volteium Menam. Itis pointed
out that the two names together implied
that he was a freedman, Volteius being
a Roman gentile name, the name of his
‘patronus,’ Menas, a Greek name, con-
tracted from Menodorus. Bishop
Lightfoot, in notes on Coloss. 4. 12, 14,
15, has collected a large number of such
contracted names.

56. praeconem, an auctioneer, as we
see from v. 65. Cp. A. P. 419 ‘praeco
ad merces qui turbam cogit emendas.’

notum has been taken separately
<Ore11.,Dillr. as ‘ bene notum ’ Epp. 1. 6.
2 5) 01· with ‘ sine crimine' ε ‘ notae probi-
tatis' (Obbar). In either of these cases
it will be best to take the infinitives
(with Orelli) as in orat. obl. after
‘narrat‚‘ not with ‘gaudentem,' which
has its own constr. with the ablatives.
1t is perhaps better however with the
more recent editors (Ritter, Keller,
Munro, Wilkins) to construet ‘notum'
with the infinitives‚ ‘ known to.' Bentley
proposed ‘sine erimine natum‚’ ‘ of blame-
less, respectable, birth,' but with hesita-
