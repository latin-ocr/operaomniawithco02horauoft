288 HORATII EPISTULARUM
detail dcfccts of Quintius' character to suit the turns of the poet's lecture. Its
personal bearing is probably satisfied with ‘we are all calling you happy, only
rcmember what the Stoics tell us happiness really means.' We have seen in Epp.
1. 1 that Horace passes from 3 personal address to professorial argument with an
imagined interlocutor without indicating the point of transition (see note on vv. 41—
43 of this Eliustltsl- Itis to be noticed that in the present Epistle hc touches in
succession 011 many current Stoic doctrines, and with sympathy, not putting in front,
as is usual with him, their paradoxical form. See notes on vv. 33, 55, 615, 79.
The connection between the description of the Sabine farm and the discussion
on standards of happiness and goodness which follows is not strongly marked.
we are meant probably to feel something of the easy inconsequence of a letter,
the early part finding its immediate explanation in some questions that Quintius
may be supposed to have asked. 'she point of actual connection is made in v. 17
by‘ Tu recte vivis ,ἲ ’ which implies that the sum of the picture given in the preced—
ing lines has been ‘ ego recte vivo.’ The retirement and simple pleasures in which
he paints himself as finding health and communem are a fitting introduction to
the remainder of the letter in which he is to argue that happiness cannot be

separated from ‘goodnesa

reddat'; so that although ‘pascat’ is
specially suitable to corn—growing land

though oliveyards were spoken of as
making rich, while cornland only finds
