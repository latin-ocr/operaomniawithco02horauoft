Privatas ut quaerat opeS, et tangere vitet

Furtivis nudata coloribus.

Ipse quid audes?

‘¹ = Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma? Non tibi parvum
Ingenium, non incultum est et turpiter hirtum.

Respondere paras, seu condis amabile carmen,

the phrase which did not originally be-
long to it: sor the true explanation of
λήκυθος seems to be given in the passage
usually quoted from Cicero, ad Att. 1. 14
⁴ Totum hunc locum quem ego varie meis
orationibus. . . soleo pingere de flamma,
de ferro (nosti illas ληκύθους) valde gra-
viter pertrahit‚' where it is clear that he
takes it to mean ‘ a paint-pot'; cp. ad
Att. 2. 1 ‘Aristotelia pigmenta! It is
however equally likely that Horace
thought only of the Greek ληκυθίζειν,
and that ‘ ampullatur’ means ‘uses the
paint-pot‚' ‘lays the colour on thick.’
This is Ritter’s view and that of Prof.
wilkins.

15. quid agit? As in Sat. 1. 9. 4
‘ How is Celsus ’ ⁴?

mihi, dat. ethicus, ‘tell me‚' ‘ I wish
to know.’ Celsus is probably to be
identified with the Celsus Albinovanus
to whom Epp. 1. 8 is addressed.

16. privatas opeS, wealth that he
can call his own.

17. Palatinus Apollo. The temple
of Apollo on the Palatine dedicated by
Augustus in B.C. 28, attached to which
was the famous library. See Od. 1. 31,
introd.

18. olim, ‘one day⁷3 see Epp. 1. 1.

19. grex avium. The form of the
fable in Horace corresponds with that
of the late Greek collection of Aesop's
sables (Fab. 78). In the earlier version
of Babrius and Phaedrus the jackdaw
dresses himself in peacock’s feathers
only.

cornicula: a word not found else-
where. It answers to κολοιός, ‘gracu—
lus,’ in the Greek sables and in Phae·

drus; but the diminutive is playful,
‘ poor little crow.’ Orelli rightly warns
us that we are not to think of Horace
as charging Celsus with what we under-
stand by ‘plagiarism' That he em·
ploys such a fable in writing of a friend
shows that he has no idea that any
moral stigma can be imagined. He is
rather urging originality on a young
writer. What he charges imitators with
(Epp. 1. 19. 19 foll.) is servility rather
than dishonesty.

21. agilis, ‘on your nimble wing.'
The point, as explained by the follow-
ing lines‚ is his versatility.

thyma. For the metaphor rather
differently applied see Od. 4. 2. 27.

22. turpiter: to the husbandman’s
disgrace.

hirtum : opp. ‘ nitentia culta‚’ ‘ bram-
blegrown.'

23. linguam acuis. The metaphor is
in Cicero; Brut. 97. 331 ‘tu illuc veneras
unus qui non linguam modo acuisses
exercitatione dicendi.’

causis is the dat., ‘ for pleading.'

civica iura respondere. Cicero
uses the phrase ‘ius respondere’ (de
Leg. 1. 412, de Orat. 1. 45. 198, see
Wilkins' note) of the ‘iurisconsultus'
giving advice on questions of law. ‘ Ci-
vica iura' is the poetical variation of
the technieal ‘ius civile.‘ For ‘ civicus ‘
see on Od.2.1.1.

24. amabile, as he calls the ‘chori
vatum ’ ‘ amabiles ' in Od. 4. 3. 14.

2 5. hederae victricis: the ivy pro-
perly belongs only to the poet (see on
Od. 1. 1. 29). The epithet ‘victricis’
(scarcely appropriate to the poet's ivy
crown, which was rather a sign of his
