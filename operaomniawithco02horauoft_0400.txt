384 INTRODUCTION TO THE

vv. 225, 386). We can distinguish the different relation which the
three persons addressed hold towards the Epistle. The father figures
rather as the critic on whom the young writer may lean, and who will
enforce Horace’s teaching, than as a poet or learner himself at the
present time. The younger son is onlyincluded as making upthe literary
family. But as the poem goes on it becomes clear that the elder son
is the person for whom the advice is intended, ‘ O maior iuvenum,
quamvis et voce paterna Fingeris ad rectum et per te sapis,' etc., and
that he is imagined as having not only literary ambitions, but definite
poetical schemes.

Horace is putting on paper an old poet’s advice to a young
aspirant. He does not discourage him, but he would enlist him, if
he is to be a poet, as a recruit in the severe and classical school. In
an age of scribblers he must give time to accumulate materials, time
to understand his business, he must subject his work to honest and
rigorous criticism; he must be slow to give it to the world.

We may distinguish perhaps three parts of the poem: but they
pass naturally into one another, and a single thread binds them
together in the repeated doctrine, that poetry is an art and as an
art has rules, and supposes previous instruction and patient effort.

Vv. 1-118 deal with general principles of poetry, unity of concep-
tion, choice of words, style of diction.

Vv. 119-284. When from diction he passes to characters it soon
becomes evident that, for some reason unexplained, he has dramatic
poetry specially in view3 and various points are touched in relation
to it, some larger, some smaller, but the leading principle through—
out is that the best Greek practice is to be the rule.

Vv. 285-end. So we go back to what is applicable to all kinds of
poetry3 the comparison of the Greek and Roman temperament, the
two aims of poetry, the necessity of excellence, the poet⁷s high call-
ing, the need of training, the folly of wilfulness.

Something of the same disproportion in the space given to the
drama has been noticed in the Ep. ad Augustum. There it has been
probably explained by the fact that dramatic writing had become
popular again in the Augustan period. But the phenomenon is
more marked in the Ars Poetica. It not only has more than its
share: it is the only kind of poetry specifically dealt with, and we
find upon it detailed and practical rules. It is difficult not to think
that the explanation lies in the line which the young Piso's literary
ambition was taking. He was planning or writing a play. How
closely Horace is touching his plans it seems impossible to define.
