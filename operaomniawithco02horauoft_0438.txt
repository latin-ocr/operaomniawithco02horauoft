HORATII ARS POETICA.

Nam neque chorda sonum reddit quem volt manus et mens,
Poscentique gravem persaepe remittit acutum3
Nec semper feriet quodcunque minabitur arcus. 350

Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis
Offendar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit

Aut humana parum cavit natura.

Quid ergo est?

Ut scriptor si peccat idem librarius usque

Quamvis est monitus venia caret; ut citharoedus 355
Ridetur chorda qui semper oberrat eadem:

Sic mihi qui multum cessat fit Choerilus ille,

Quem bis terque bonum cum risu miror3 et idem
Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus;

3485358. ‘As we know in other arts,
no instrument can be perfectly depended
on, There will occur failures. But Ι
shall not be offended at them (if the
merits overbalance) whether they pro-
ceed from carelessness or from causeS‚
like the failing string, which the poet
being human has not provided against.
But this does not mean that he may
omit always to provide against the same
failincr?

353. quodcunque minabitur: the
internal accus, cp. Od. Ι. 28. 25 3 ⁴ what-
ever shall be its threats,' i.e. whenever
it is so aimed as to look as if it must
strike.

353. quid ergo est, ‘what is the
concliisionP' i.e. let us understand the
limits of our indulgence.

354. scriptor librarius ι one of the
slaves employed to copy books, of whose
negligence Cicero complains, ad Quint.
Fr. 3. 5. 6 ‘de Latinis [libris] quo me
vertam nescio: ita mendose et scri-
buntur et veneunt.’ Cp. Mart. 2. 8. 1
‘ nocuit librarius illis.'

357. qui multum cessat. Quintilian
has ‘cesso‚’ in exactly the same sense,
1. 10. 4 ⁶ oratoris perfecti illius et nulla
parte cessantis? Some metaphor seems
to be suggested, as of sailing to keep up
in a march, or of the lapses of a lazy
slave, Epp. 2. 2. 14.

fit Choerilus ille: is put by me
on the level of the notorious mediocre
poet ; see Epp. 2. 1. 233 f.

358. bis terque. Bentley first pointed
out (on Epod. 5. 33, see my note there)
the true difference between ⁴ bis terque7’
‘ tu ice and (even) thrice ’ and ‘ bis terve‚⁷
‘twice or (at most) thrice? The first
having an amplifying force, and so

making the phrase often (not always)
equivalent to ‘saepe’ (cp. with Schiitz
‘ terque quaterque ' Sat. 2. 7. 76,
‘ter et quater⁷ Od. 1. 31. 13); the
latter, a minimizing one, reducing it to
‘raro.' He was right therefore in 1. c.
in preserring ‘ bis te1·que,⁷ and the evi·
dence of MSS. accumulated since has
abundantly confirmed his judgment.
In this case he wished, on the autho-
rity of one MS. not of the first class, to
substitute ‘ bis terve’ for ‘ bis terque‚'
and his reading has since received the
weighty support of B. Orelli and
Munro follow him. Ritter, SchiitZ, and
Keller retain ‘ bis terque' as the best
attested reading. The sense here will
be satisfied with either reading. Any
contemptuous generosity of concession
to the bad poet is overbalanced by the
‘ indignor quandoque ' of the contrasted
clause.

et idem z though at the same time Ι.

359. quandoque: for ‘quandocun-
que’ Od. 4. 2. 34. My standard of ex-
cellence for Homer is so high that
every single declension from it is noted
and made much of.

bonus cannot be separated from
‘bonum’ In the contrasted v. 358. It
is not therefore a half respeetful, half
familiar designation like ‘pater Ennius.’
Epp. 1. 19. 7—but has emphasis, and
is part of the predication. Choerilus is
the bad poet occasionally good. Homer
is the good poet occasionally, if so it be,
nodding. Quintilian refers to this line
in a passage of good sense, 10.1. 24
‘neque id statim legenti persuasum sit
onmia quae magni auctores dixerint ubi-
que esse perfecta. Nam et labuntur
aliquando, et oneri cedunt, et indulgent
