edit. There is no direct testimony to the
reading of V; g, which follows it on
other difficult questions, has ‘petere⁷
The testimony of the Scholiasts is not
clear. Porph. favours ‘petere‚' ‘ Carne
tamen hanc magis illa petere te de-
ceptum imparibus formis quamvis nihil
distet esto.⁷ On the other hand the
note which goes by the name of Aer.
reeognizes ‘ patet,' ‘ Sensus est : quam-
vis hac carne nihil distet magis illa te
patet imparibus formis deceptum,' ‘ ma-
gis, delectaris] ⁴ illa (al. illam) non dis·
tat, inquit, seci ideo petis quia maior est.'
It will be seen that this contains in-
consistent interpretations—the first sen-
tence, taking ‘hac carne ' with · distat ’ ;
the second supplying ‘ delectaris' as
Orelli supplies ‘vesceris'; both how-
ever exclude ‘ pdtere ² in that they pro-
vide ‘magis' with a verb without it;
the third sentence seems to give a link
between the interpretations of Acr. and
of Porph., and possibly to have been,
through Porph.’s scholion, the origin of
the reading ‘ petere.⁷ On the other hand
⁴ patet' in Acr. may be due to an inter-
pretation of the infinitive. If we read
‘ petere ’ it seems to be necessary to ac-
cept also either‘hanc’ or ‘illam,’ of which
the first has the authority of Porph.,
the latter of several good MSS. ; and it
is better to construet ‘te petere' as an
exclamation Madv. ξ 399, not as Porph.
took it as following ‘esto.' Reading
⁶ patet,' the simplest constr. is Bentley's
‘ yet in point os flesh there is nothing to
choose‚ in this flesh over that, it is evi-
dent that you are beguiled by the differ-
ence of outside.’ Orelli following Acr.
puts a stop at ‘illa‚' and supposes a
very harsh ellipsis, ‘yet though there is
no difference in the flesh [you eat (ves-
ceris)] this in preference to that? In
either case ‘ hac⁷ is the peacock's flesh.
With the reading ‘petere ' ‘hnc' is that
of the common fowl—not as the last
mentioned, but as the one which the
poet is recommending ; cp. the inversion
os thlf· usual order in verses 36, 37 ‘illis
. . . is.

30. esto, ‘be it so.' Vou may be
soolish; but you have something to say
for yourself. If there is no dist‘erence to
the taste there is to the cye; but what
is the new sense which enables you to
distinguish the waters from which a
particular fish came.

31. unde datum. Sat. 2. 1. 52 ‘unde
monstratum) It differs from Sat. 1. 4.

pontes inter. This is the traditional
description of the feeding ground os the
‘lupus.' Lucilius, fr. inc. 50 ‘pontes
Tiberinus duo inter captus catillo,'
Macrob. Sat. 2. 13. So Plin. N. H. 9.
54. What ‘ inter duo pontes ’ meant in
Lucilius' time is not known. VVords-
worth <Early Latin, p. 631) explains it
as meaning ⁶ off the island.'

iactatus, i. e. by the current, not an
ornamental edition. Columel. 8. 16
‘ docta palata fastidire docuit fiuvialem
lupum nisi quemTiberis adverso torrente
defatigasset.'

33. Tusci. Od. 3. 7. 28 ‘Tusco
alveo‚' Virg. G. 1. 499 ‘Tuscum Ti-
berim.’

trilibrem. Plin. N. H. 9. 30 ⁶ [mulli]
binas libras ponderis raro admodum
exsuperant.' Seneca (Epist. 95) tells a

story of one of four pounds; Juvenal
(S. 4. 15‘) osone of six.
34. singula pulmenta, ‘separate

portions’—in helping the guests. The
argument is the same as in Sat. 1. 1. 45
foll. Store is set by the size ofthe fish 3
yet large or small it has to be carved
into small pieces before it is eaten.

35. video, like ‘ esto' in 30, grants
the explanation, ‘your eye is pleased‚’
in order to press the inconsistency—
‘why then does it dislike in the pike
what it dislikes in the mullet? The
Epicurean would possibly have found a
good answer.
