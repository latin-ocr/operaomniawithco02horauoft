LIB. II.

SAT. 3. 157

Lautis mane senex manibus currebat et, ‘Unum——
Quid tam magnum? ’ addens‚—‘ unum me surpite morti,
Dis etenim facile estl’ orabat3 sanus utrisque

Auribus atque oculis3 mentem, nisi litigiosus,
Exciperet dominus cum venderet.

Chrysippus ponet fecunda in gente Meneni.
‘Iuppiter, ingentes qui das adimisque dolores,'
Mater ait pueri menses iarn quinque cubantis,

‘Frigida si puerum quartana reliquerit, illo

Mane die quo tu indicis ieiunia nudus

In Tiberi stabit.'

Casus medicusve levarit

Aegrum ex praecipiti, mater delira necabit
In gelida fixum ripa febrimque reducet3

Quone malo mentem concussa?

285

Hoc quoque volgus
290
Timore deorum. 295

Haec mihi Stertinius, sapientum octavus, amico
Arma dedit, posthac ne compellarer inultus.

282. lautis manibus, a ritual pro-
priety. The edd. quote from ΙΙ. 6. 266
χερσὶ δ’ ἀνίπτοισιν Διὶ λείβειν αἴθοπα
οἶνον l ἅζομαι.

283. quid tam magnum? He puts
what is the essence of the impossibility,
the fact that it would be the breach of a
universal law, as though it were the
convincing proof of its easiness—‘it is
such a small concession.'

surpite, for ‘ surripite ' ; see on Od. 4.
13. 20 ‘ surpuerat.' So in Virg. Aen. 8.
274 ‘ porgo ' for ‘ porrigo‚’ and in com-
mon use ⁶ surgo ' for ‘ surrigo.'

285. nisi litigiosus, ‘unless he
wished for a law-suit.⁷ For the practice
of warranting a slave when sold, and
specifying his desects, see Epp. 2. 2. 1-
19. The verb ‘ excipere' is used there (v.
16) as here. The figure is specially
applicable here as the person spoken of
is a ‘ libertinus.' ‘ Were he stilla slave,
and being sold, his master would,' etc.

286. volgus, i. e. the superstitious,
for there are plenty of them.

287. Chrysippus. The Stoie's text-
book ; see above on v. 44, Sat. 1. 3. 1 27.

Meneni. There is no evidence but
the text. The ‘ gens Meneni ’ must
mean lunatics ; but why, the Scholiasts
knew no more than we. It is very pos-
sibly a literary reference; see p. 13.

289. cubantis, ‘who has been keep-
ing his bed ’; see on Sat. 1. 9. 18.

290. quartana: an ague whose fits

return at intervals of four days.

291. quo tu indicis ieiunia. The
referenceis, as is usual when superstitious
observance is in question, to the adop-
tion of Jewish practices. The division
of time by weeks, and the naming of the
seven days after the sun, moon, and five
planets, though not adopted civilly till
the time of Theodosius, was known to
the Romans at this time, and is the sub-
ject of occasional allusion. The ‘dies
Iovis,’ therefore, is our Thursday; but
the fast on the fifth day was not a Roman
but a Jewish practice, one of the inter-
polated ‘two fastings in the week' of
St. Luke 18. Cp. Tibullus Ι. 3. 18
‘Saturni sacram me tenuisse diem,’ where
‘Saturni dies ⁷ is the Jewish sabbath.
On the whole subject see Hare’s article
on the ⁶ Days of the week ⁷ in vol. Ι. of
the Philological Journal 1832.

292, levarit : for the omission of ἰ si ’
see on Sat. 1. 1. 45 ; ‘ have lifted him
from the brink.’ ‘ In praecipiti ' is used
for ‘ in mortal peril' by Celsus the me-
dical writer, 2. 6.

294. fixum, ‘ by planting him?

295. quone. For the redundant ‘ ne '
see on Epod. 1. 7.

timore deorum, δεισιδαιμονίᾳ.

296. sapientum octavus: one who
deserved to be ranked next to the famous
seven sages of Greece.

297. compellar-er, ‘ be called names' ;
Sat. 1. 7. 31.
