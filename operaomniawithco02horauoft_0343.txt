GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
LITERARY EPISTLES.

THERE remain three Epistles (ad Augustum, ad Florum, ad
Pisones) which are often classed together as the three Epistles of
the Second Book, an arrangement which derives a prima facie ap-
propriateness from their general likeness in topics and scale. The
title, however, as applied to the three has no ancient authority.
The MSS. and Scholia agree in placing the first two together in
their present order and calling them the Second Book. The third
Epistle is referred to by Quintilian twice, once as Horace's ‘Ars
Poetica ¹,' once as the ‘liber de arte poetica ζ’ and the former title is
given to it by Terentius Scaurus (Hadrian’s reign) as quoted by
Charisius. Charisius himself cites a passage from it as from ‘the
Epistles.' In the MSS. and Scholia it is a waif and stray placed
generally after the Fourth Book of the Odes, less frequently aster the
Carmen Seculare, once after the Epodes.

Its present position is due to the editors of the middle of the
sixteenth century. Cruquius (1578) is the first who calls it the third
Epistle of Book 2.

It will be convenient, however, without committing ourselves be-
forehand to any theory of their relation, to put together what has to
be said on the difficult question of the date and circumstances of the
three Epistles.

The first two give perhaps some indication of having been placed
together by Horace as companion poems and in their present order,
in the fact that while one is addressed to Augustus, the other, al-
though it is addressed to Florus, carries in its first line a compliment
to Tiberius. This reminds us of the careful distribution of honour
between the Emperor and his step-sons in Book 4 of the Odes;
and the argument is strengthened if, as seems probable, the Epistle

¹ Ep. ad Tryph. 2. ² Inst. 8. 3. 60.
