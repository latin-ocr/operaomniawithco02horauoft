HORATII ARS POETICA.

Rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus,

Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus.

Publica materies privati iuris erit, si
Non circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem,
Nec verbo verbum curabis reddere fidus

latter of poetry. There is however, he
says, a difference iu the treatment of
them between Comedy and Tragedy.
The first invents a plot and assigns
names as it happens (τὰ τυχόντα). The
second clings generally to pre-existing
and familiar names (γενομένα, γνώριμα).
[In ‘names' he evidently includes the
outline of the story] It gains by this
credibility (τό πιθανόν), i. e. its plot is
accepted without questions of its possi-
bility. He goes on to argue that in
accepting these traditional subjeets the
tragic poet does not cease to be a
ποιητής, a creator, an artist. There is
room, as he says further in c. 14. ξ 5,
both sor invention and for skilful treat-
ment of the traditional story.

1 28. difficile est proprie communia
dicere. This is, in the first instance,
a general, perhaps a proverbial sayiug ²¹⁴.
‘ It is hard to speak of things common
in a way of your own.' The ques—
tion arises only as to the application of
the saying at the moment. It is possible
that, as has been suggested in the last
note. Horace is glaucing at the Aristo-
telian distinction of ‘truths general'
which are the proper subjects of poetry.
In any case, if our view of the whole
passage is correct, the special instance
of the difficulty spoken of must be sub-
stantially that which Orelli explains it
to be, namely, that of giving individual
Shape to common types of human lise
and character. Many editors feel so
strongly the necessity of making ‘ com-
munia ' identical (not in figure only, but
in interpretation l with ‘ publica materies,'
that they are forced to take it of subjects
already made public property, such as
the story of the 11iad; Horace being
supposed to be enforcing still the teach-
ing of the first half of v. 119. ‘ It is so
difficult to give a new turn to well-
known stories, that you had better

give up the attempt and simply copy
Homer.’ The connected sense of the
passage seems to me then to fall to
leces.

p tuque rectius. The emphatic per-
sonal address, and the mood and tense
of ‘ deducis,' ‘ proserres’ are all in favour
ofthe view that Piso was actually writ-
ing, or purposing to write, a tragedy
on some Homeric theme. This suits
also with the expression of v. 120 ‘si
forte reponis,' etc. If it is not so, we
must take ‘ rectius deducis ’ as a short-
ened way of saying ‘rectius agis si
deducis.'

131. publiea . . . privati iuris. There
is a shadow of legal metaphor. Though
the subjects have been treated by pre-
vious writers, you will still be able to
make them your own.

132. orbem. Most naturally ex-
plained of the choice of author or story.
Horace is contemplating, as always,
the recourse of a Roman writer to
some Greek model, and he is hardly
likely to omit reference to this point, on
which he lays such stress elsewhere.
‘ Go‚’ he is always saying, ‘ to the foun-
tain heads—the really great Greeks—
Homer, Pindar, Archilochus, Alcaeus,
not to the second-rate poets whom it is
the sashion to imitate.’ So that the
‘cheap and obvious round’ will be
the equivaleut of the ‘lacus et rivos
apertos,’ which he praises Titius for
venturing to have a soul above, Epp. Ι.

do not attempt translation; (2) that

even in imitation you take sufficient
freed0m; (3) that you avoid pretentious
beginnings. Homer is the example of
the true order.’

³* Orelli suggests that there was a Greek proverb--which is quite likely—but none such has
been found. 'l'he nearest expression in Greek that is quoted is from Hermogenes, the wrlter on
Rhetoric (ΑΛ). 160-180), who, in his treatise περὶ μεθόδου δεινότητος c. 29, explains how great
