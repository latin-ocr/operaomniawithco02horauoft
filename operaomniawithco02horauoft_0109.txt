Et prensare manu lentissima brachia, nutans,

Distorquens oculos, ut me eriperet.

Ridens dissimulare: meum iecur urere bilis.
‘Certe nescio quid secreto velle loqui te

Aiebas mecum.' ‘Memini bene, sed meliore
Tempore dicam; hodie tricesima sabbata: vin tu

Curtis Iudaeis oppedere?' ‘Nulla mihi‚' inquam,

‘ Religio est)

Multorum: ignosces: alias loquar?

Tam nigrum surrexe mihi!
Sub cultro linquit.

Adversarius, et: ‘Quo tu turpissimeP’ magna

and I ask him. The comment of the
Schol. is ‘eleganter mixtum inter se
et confusum sermonem interrogandi re-
spondendique expressit.'

64. prensare, ‘to grasp with the
hand' is a further step to ‘twitching’
(the ‘toga') with the fingers. There is
a variant ‘ pressare‚' ‘ to squeeze‚’ which
Orelli adopts. It was possibly read by
the SchoL, who interpret ‘ stringe1·e‚' ‘ re-
stringere.y On the other hand all Cru-
quius' MSS. (i. e. it may be presumed, V)
had ‘ prensare.’

lentissima, pred, the arms gave no
sign of feeling.

65. male, ‘ unkindly.'

66. dissimulare, ‘ pretends not to
notice.'

ieeur, Od. 1. 13. 4.

69. tricesima sabbata. Muchlearn—
ing and ingenuity have been expended
upon these words, but it is probable‚ as
Macleane suggested, that the riddle has
no answer. Some words with a mystic
sound, but chosen at random‚ would
suit the conditions of the ease. If a
definite solution is to be looked for, the
most likely is that of the Schol., who
refer the words to the new moon 3 ‘ sab-
bata ’ being used generally as the Jewish
term for a sacred day, and ‘ tricesima'
meaning ⁶ on the 30th day ' (Dillr. quotes
from Ovid, A. A. 1. 76 ⁶ Cultaque Iudaeo
septima saera Syro,’ where ⁶ septima
sacra’=‘seventh-day rites ⁷), the goth
day of the ‘full’ months, the Greek
ἔνη καὶ νέα, being the day on which the
new moon was watched for; see Diet.
Bibl. s. v. New Moon. Taking the
words to mean the goth Sabbath in the
year, they have been variously explained,

which would fall about 30 weeks from
the beginning of the Jewish civil year,
sc. from Tisri‚ our Sept.—Oct.; (2) by
Orelli, following Roeder and an un-
named Biblical scholar, either of the
Feast of Tabernacles or of the Great Day
os Atonement, each being according to
various calculations the 30th ‘sabbath‘
from the first of Nisan, the beginning of
the ecclesiastical year, and correspond-
ing to our March—April. For the ob-
servance by superstitious Romans of the
Jewish Sabbath see Mayor's note on Juv.

Cp. also Sat. 2. 3. 291.

71. unus multorum, ‘one of the

nenses; so Cicero Brut. 79. 274 ‘[M.
Calidius] non fuit orator unus e multis‚’
‘ an ordinary orator.'

culties of this passage are exhaustively
discussed in Long's note to Cic. Verr.
2. 3. 15. They turn upon the use of the
phrase ‘ in ius vocare' there ‘ rapere ⁷),
which seems in legal phraseology to
have been restricted to the first appear-
ance before the Praetor, before the
giving of ‘vades‚’ the remedy after-
wards being the loss of the suit and
