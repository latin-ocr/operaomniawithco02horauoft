HORATII SATIRARUM

Heres et, si quis casus puerum egerit Orco,

In vacuum venias:

perraro haec alea fallit. 50

Qui testamentum tradet tibi cunque legendum,
Abnuere et tabulas a te removere memento.
Sic tamen ut limis rapias quid prima secundo
Cera velit versu3 solus multisne coheres,

Veloci percurre oculo.

Plerumque recoctus 55

Scriba ex quinqueviro corvum deludet hiantem,
Captatorque dabit risus Nasica Coran0.’

Num furis? an prudens ludis me obscura canendo?

‘ O Laertiade, quicquid dicam aut erit aut non:

Divinare etenim magnus mihi donat Apollo.’ 60
Quid tamen ista velit sibi fabula, si licet, ede.

‘Tempore quo iuvenis Parthis horrendus, ab alto

the two clauses which the repetition of
‘¹ et ' implies, for ‘ heres secundus ‘ seems
to mean what was legally called ‘ heres
substitutus‚‘ i.e. a person named to
receive the inheritance in default of the
first-named heir (· institutus '). Heind„

noticing that a few MSS. give ‘ut’

without ⁴ et‚’ wished to read for ‘ ut et'

‘uti,' the second clause then only ex-

plaining the first. Very probably how-
ever Sch'utz is right in taking the two
clauses of two distinct wssls, the suppo-
sition being that the sickly boy dies
before his father and the legacy-hunter
fills the gap, by being made first heir
in a fresh will.

49. Orco: sor dat. see on Od. 1. 24.
18.

50. alea. It is a hazard, a playing
for ehances, as contrasted with the
simpler process of making up in the
first instance to a childless man, but it
is a hazard that seldom disappoints.

51. quicunque, (as often)=‘when·
ever any one.’

53, limis, sc.
glance.'

prima cera, which Juvenal (S. 4. 193
calls ‘ praecipua cera ' ; the will is sup-
posed to be written on several waxed
tablets.

secundo versu, ‘the second line’;
the first would contain the testator's
name. It is implied that the second
would contain the name of the legatee.

55. plerumque, ‘very often) See
on Sat. 1. 10. 15.

‘oculis‚’ ‘by a side

recoctus scriba ex quinqueviro.
A commissioner who has gone into the
melting pot and come out as a clerk.
Cicero uses ‘ quinquevir ' as the title of
one os the humblest of public officers,
Acad. Prior. 2. 44 ‘neminem consulem
praetorem imperatorem, nes cio an ne
quinquevirum quidem quer quam nisi
sapientem. Aeornmission offive, perhaps
the one intended, had charge of the
night police. The purpose os the
description is not apparent. Possibly,
as some editors think, it means that he
was a man whose antecedents made it
unlikely that he should be taken in.
But it may be only persona-I, and beyond
our power (as indeed the story is) wholly
to unriddle.

56. corvumhiantem. The raven in
Aesop's sable (NPhaedr. 1. 13) opened its
mouth at the fox's flattery to sing and
dropped the eheese. Horace is referring
to this fable, but as usually is the case
with his reference to sables, to a single
point in it.

59. It seems clear that Horace is
parodying the ambiguous utterance of
an ancient oracle. ‘ Iocatur in ambigua
responsa’ Schol. The words might
mean to Tiresias ‘will be (if so 1 have
said) or will not be (if so I have said),'
but they would also bear and were meant
to bear the safe meaning ‘ either will be
or will not be?

62. iuvenis. Od. 1. 2. 41 n.

alto: Od. 3. 4. 37 n. Cp. Virg. Aen.
6. 500 ‘genus alto a sanguine Teucri.’
