HORATII SATIRARUM

Effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus,

Cum rapies in ius malis ridentem alienis,

Fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum et cum volet a1·bor.’

Si male rem gerere insani est, contra bene sani,

Putidius multo cerebrum est, mihi crede, Perelli, 75
Dictantis quod tu nunquam rescribere possis.

Audire atque togam iubeo componere, quisquis

Ambitione mala aut argenti pallet amore,

Quisquis luxuria tristive superstitione

Aut alio mentis morbo calet3

huc propius me, 80

Dum doceo insanire omnes, vos ordine adite.

71. Proteus, the sea-god, as de-
scribed in Hom. Odyss. 4. 485 and
Virg. Georg. 4. 387 foll. He would
only give eracles when he was bound,
but when men tried to bind him he
eluded them by changing into a thou-
sand shapes.

72. malis ridentem alienis. There
can hardly but be some relation to
Homer's γναθμοῖσι γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισιν
Odyss. 22. 345, though how close an
one it is (lifficult to say. Eustathius in
loc. tells us that the words had passed
into a proverb, and proverbs, especially
in another language‚ are constantly mis-
used. It is possible that Horace, re-
minded of the Odyssey by the image
of Proteus, recalls the words and pur-
posely gives thern a quasi-comic adap-
tation. It is possible again that they
occur to him as a blank form of expres-
sion without their context, as ‘ cui bono '
occurred to Byron, and he puts his own
meaning to them (see his use of a Greek
proveib in v. 276). What the actual
meaning put on them is, is not certain.
It may be his disguises, ‘laughing
from behind strange masks‚' or it may
be with a play on ‘ aes alienum,' of the
debtor’s complete indebtedness, ‘ laugh-
ing as though even his cheeks were
borrowed (and so need not be spared„'

74. bene, sc. ‘ gerere.'

75. putidius, as we speak of ‘ addled
brains.'

Perelli: this and not ‘Perilli’ is
the spelling of the MSS. ‘Perellius'
is identified by the Acr. with the
⁶ Cicuta’ of v. 69. It may be so. In
any case the name is here given to
the ‘ creditor' of whom we are speak-
ing, so that it is ‘a Perellius‚' i. e. ‘a
moneylender.‘

76. dictantis . . . rescribere: the
correlatives from two sides of srribe in
v. 69. The money-lendes prescribes the
formula ofthe hond, the borrower writes
and signs it, and should by and by
cancel it, write it off, by repayment
of the money borrowed.

tu. Stertinius is again addressing
Damasippus.

77 foll. Here Stertinius’ discourse
takes a larges sweep, as he fancies him-
self addressing an audience. It is in
appearance brought within the frame-
work of the Satire in v. 296, but we
are hardly intended actually to picture
Stertinius as (lelivering it to Damasippus
on the bridge. See what I have said of
Ofellus's sermon in introd. to Sat. 2. 2.

77Α ‘cogam componere. The Schol.
explain it of the respect due to a
teacher. They also notice the ὕστερον
πρότερον. lt is like Virgil's ‘moriamur
et in media arma ruamus' Aen. 2. 553,
etc., the order not of chronology of
fact but of prominence in thought.

78. ambitione mala: Sat. 2. 6. 183
cp. the epithets ‘misera gravique' Sat.
1. 6. 12 .

paneg, as ‘ morbo calet‚' the language
of medicine.

81. Some question has been raised
as to the punctuation. Heindorf puts
the stop at ‘vos,⁷ Prof. Palmer at ⁶ or-
dine‚⁷ in order to indicate that ‘omnes '
is not ‘all men' but ‘you all‚’ the
classes of *stulti’ who have been al-
ready named; but even if we stop at
‘omnes‚' as on rhythmical grounds it
seems well to do, we naturally under-
stand ‘ vos ’ as a subj. to ‘ insanire.’

ordine adite, as to an oraele rather
than a lecturer. For a sornewhat simila
mixture of figures cp. Od. 3. 1. 1 foll.
