LIB. I.

‘Si pranderet olus patienter, regibus uti

Nollet Aristippus.'
Fastidiret olus qui me notat.’

EPIST. 17. 301
‘Si sciret regibus uti,
Utrius horum 15

Verba probes et facta doce, vel iunior audi
Cur sit Aristippi potior sententia; namque
Mordaccm Cynicum sic eludebat, ut aiunt:
‘Scurror ego ipse mihi, populo tu; rectius hoc et

Splendidius rnulto est.

Equus ut rne portet, alat rex, 20

Officium facio: tu poscis vilia, verum
Dante minor, quamvis fers te nullius egentem.'
Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et reS‚

whether ‘ unctum’ is neut. as in A. P.
422, ‘as a hungry man to a savoury
dinner‚' or masc, the epithet being
transferred from the sare to the person
who partakes of it. ‘Siccus’ is most
easily explained by Sat. 2. 2. 14. It
is possible, however, that it is more
closely related to ‘unctumj meaning
one who lives on dry food, Cicero's
‘aridus victus' Rosc. Am. 27. 75; ep.
ξηροφαγεΐν.

13—15. The saying of Diogenes and
the reply of Aristippus were traditional.
Diog. Laert. Ι. 68 παριόντα ποτε αὐτὸν
(Ἀρίστιππον) λάχανα πλύνων Διογένης
ἔσκωψε καί φησιν, Εἰ ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσ-
φέρεσθαι οὐκ ἂν τυράννων αὐλὰς ἐθερά-
πευες. Ὁ δέ, καὶ σύ, εἶπεν, εἴπερ ᾔδεις
ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν οὐκ ἂν λάχανα ἔπλυνες.
For Aristippus see on Epp. 1. 1. 18.

13. pranderet, with accus„ as in Sat.
2. 3. 245: so ‘cenare' Epp. 2. 2. 168,
Sat. 2. 8. 27, etc.

uti: see above on v. 2.

15. qui me notat, ‘my censor.' For
the metaph. use see on Sat. 1. 3. 24.

16. iunior, ‘ as the younger ' : i. e. ‘ I
take my privilege of age ’ ; see introd.

18, mordacem, ‘snappish.’ as a eur;
the usual play on the name ‘ Cynic.’

ut aiunt seems to imply that Horace
is still following some well-known story
of Aristippus; but his saying is free'ly
paraphrased and adapted to the purpose
of the moment. Porph. quotes a Greek
proverb ἵππος με φέρει, βασιλεύς με
τρέφει.

19. scurror mihi. He begins
with the offensixe term for the profes-
sion (cp. ‘scurrantis' Epp. 1. 18. 2)
to be sostened (as Porph. points out)
to ‘ officium facio,' ‘render my service‚’

in v. 21. ‘ We are both “ scurrae‚’⁷ for
we gain our sustenance by pleasing some
one else; but in my case Ι am really
pleasing myself, for by pleasing my
patron Ι make him please me.’

61100, ‘my plan’: see on Sat. 2. 2.

21. facio: for the om. of ‘ego' see
on Epp. 1. 14. 40.

verum. The constr. is ‘tu poscis
vilia, verum [poscis] dante minor,'
‘what you ask is worthless‚ but in
asking it you humble yourself to the
giver.' This (or ‘verum es ') is the
reading of all MSS. of authority, in-
cluding all the Bland. Horace sre-
quently begins a clause or sentence with
‘ verum’ at the end of a line and after
a stop: Sat. 1. 2. 923 Epp.1.1. So, 2.
2. 70, 106; A. P. 303. 'she alternative
reading ‘ rerum’ was introduced into the
text by Lambinus from some of his MSS.
It was accepted without comment by
BentL, and is given by Orelli, Dillr.
and Munro. ‘Vilia rerum’ is then
constructed as ‘ abdita rerum ⁷ A. P. 49,
‘vanis rerum’ Sat. 2. 2. 25, ‘fictis
rerum ’ Sat. 2. 8. 83. Ritter points out
that ‘rerum' is wrongly given for
‘verum’ by some MSS. in Epp. 2. 2.
45 and 70. He writes ‘verums' for
‘ verum es.’

22. dante minor. ‘However paltry
the boon, you at once become the depen-
dent of him who supplies it, for all
your boast of i11dependence.'

nullius: possibly best taken (with
Orelli) as a masc. ‘in need of no man‚‘
as suiting ‘ dante minor,' It is neut. in
A. P. 324.

23. color, as Sat. 2. 1. 60 ‘vitae
color!
